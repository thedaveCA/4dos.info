   Check through this file for a comprehensive list of what's changed in
   Take Command/16 for Windows 3.x since version 1.01.  Additional
   documentation on new features is in the online help.  Information about
   product changes before version 1.01 may be viewed at our web page
   (http://www.jpsoft.com) by selecting Take Command and then Product
   History.  Many product history files are also available in our
   Compuserve forum (GO PCVENB or GO JPSOFT, library 10 / JP Software, look
   for files named UPxxxxxx.ZIP).

   Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
   you aren't using a feature, feel free to skip to the next item.  If you
   are new to Take Command with version 1.01, you can skip this file
   entirely, and begin with the Introduction and Installation Guide.

   This file is divided into the following sections:

          General Features and Enhancements
          Startup and Initialization
          Command Changes
          Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes

   Significant new features and those which affect most users are marked
   with "**" in the lists below.  Other items discuss smaller or more
   technical changes.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the LIST
   command, or printed on most PC printers using the command:

              copy updat102.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

                       Take Command/16 1.02 Change List


   General Features and Enhancements
   ---------------------------------

   ==> ** Increased the maximum history size from 8K to 32K. 

   ==> ** The print dialog now allows printing a marked block of text, by
          using the "Print Selection" button.  The button will only be
          enabled if text is marked.

   ==>    In the find files dialog, removed the file description / date /
          time text field from under the list box, due to difficulties
          synchronizing updates of this information with list box
          scrolling.  This information is still available by double-
          clicking the file name in this list box.


   Startup and Initialization
   --------------------------

   ==>    Added a new .INI directive:

              AppendToDir = [Yes | NO]:  If set to "Yes", TCMD will append
              a trailing '\' to directory names when doing filename
              completion.


   Command Changes
   ---------------

   ==>    IF ISWINDOW:  Now supports wildcards in the window name.

   ==> ** LIST:  Enabled mouse button 2 for "copy & paste" operation inside
          LIST.  To use this feature, hold the button down and select an
          area by dragging the cursor.  When you release the button, the
          marked area is copied to the clipboard.  This is the same
          behavior that was already available in the command window.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes 
   ---------------------------------------

   ==>    DESCRIPT.ION now allows either a space, tab, or comma as the
          delimiter between the filename and the description.  This is for
          compatibility with some third-party description files.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with marking more than one line using the
          keyboard (e.g. using Shift-Home at the end of a multi-line
          command).

   ==>    Fixed a problem with files executed via executable extensions. 
          Double quotes are now added if the name contains whitespace.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with NUL characters in batch files.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with redirection and NoClobber (NoClobber was
          effectively being ignored).

   ==>    Fixed a problem with the HistCopy directive.

   ==>    Fixed the Find Files dialog so the Disks box correctly reflects
          choices made with the radio buttons.

   ==>    If you are using TCMD/16 as the Windows shell you may now hold
          down the SHIFT key when starting TCMD to prevent programs in the
          STARTUP group from executing (as you can in Program Manager).

   ==>    Take Command now passes the Pause key on to other applications
          (this should resolve problems found while using SpinWizard).

   ==>    The PATH search routine now queries if the specified drive is
          ready before attempting to find an external command, which avoids
          a critical error message.

   ==>    DDEEXEC:  Added a wait to solve a problem slower systems may have
          with terminating DDE links and fixed a problem with DDEEXEC not
          passing the command arguments.

   ==>    DO:  Now allows embedded equal signs in a test condition.

   ==>    FOR:  Fixed a problem with include lists in the FOR arguments and
          enabled extended parent directory names.

   ==>    IF:  Added a work-around for constructs like:

              if 1 == 0 echo foo && echo bar

          to emulate CMD.EXE's behavior of basing the && condition on the
          result of the IF test.

   ==>    INPUT:  Fixed a problem with using INPUT /E in a transient shell
          and solved a problem with INPUT /W /E which prevented the
          existing value from being displayed unless a key was pressed.

   ==>    KEYSTACK:  Fixed a sporadic problem with feeding keystrokes to
          message boxes.

   ==>    LIST:  Fixed problems with:  Using Find with wrap on; marking
          wrapped lines; marking long lines with several embedded tabs; and
          selecting long filenames from the Open dialog.





   Take Command 1.02  [04-17-96] UPDAT102.DOC                        page 3


   ==>    LIST:  Improved LIST's ability to find the end of each line
          properly in files with unusual line terminations (e.g. CR or LF
          alone, LF/CR, CR/CR/LF, etc.).

   ==>    MD:  Fixed a problem with /S and UNC names.
