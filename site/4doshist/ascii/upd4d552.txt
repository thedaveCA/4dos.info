   Check through this file for a comprehensive list of what's changed since
   version 5.51.  Additional documentation on new features is in the online
   help.  Information about product changes before version 5.51 may be
   viewed at our web page (http://www.jpsoft.com) by selecting 4DOS and
   then Product History.  Many product history files are also available in
   our Compuserve forum (GO PCVENB or GO JPSOFT, library 10 / JP Software,
   look for files named UPxxxxxx.ZIP).

   Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
   you aren't using a feature, feel free to skip to the next item.  If you
   are new to 4DOS with version 5.52, you can skip this file entirely, and
   begin with the 4DOS Introduction and Installation Guide.

   This file is divided into the following sections:

          General Features and Enhancements
          Startup and Initialization
          Command Line Editing Changes
          Command Changes
          Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (General)
          Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (Windows 95)

   Significant new features and those which affect most users are marked
   with "**" in the lists below.  Other items discuss smaller or more
   technical changes.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the 4DOS LIST
   command, or printed on most PC printers using the command:

                  copy updat552.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

                             4DOS 5.52 Change List

   General Features and Enhancements
   ---------------------------------

   ==> ** In Win95, file searches now look for long filenames and then
          short filenames.  For example, suppose you have two files on your
          system:

                  Long Name           Short Name
                  ------------------  ------------------
                  My Letter.DAT       MYLETT~1.DAT
                  Files.DAT           MYFILES.DAT

          A search for MY*.DAT will now find both files; previously it
          would find only the first file.  This was done to improve
          compatibility with COMMAND.COM and to make the results more
          intuitive.

          CAUTION:  Extra care should be taken performing certain commands
          on long filenames (e.g. using wildcards to delete or move files),
          as they may now affect files with short names as well.  For
          example, DEL *1 will delete all files whose names end in "1". 
          Because short filenames generated by Windows 95 end in "~1", such
          a command would delete all of those files -- probably not the
          result you wanted.


   Startup and Initialization
   --------------------------

   ==>    Added a new .INI directive:

              AppendToDir = [Yes | NO]:  If set to "Yes", TCMD will append
              a trailing \ to directory names when doing filename
              completion.


   Command Line Editing Changes
   ----------------------------

   ==> ** In Win95 a Ctrl-A on the command line during filename expansion
          will now toggle the returned filename between long filename (LFN)
          and the traditional short name (SFN) format.  The default is LFN
          format; if you switch to SFN format the change will only remain
          in effect for the current filename expansion.  Any new expansion
          sequence later on the command line will start in LFN format, and
          can be toggled to SFN format with another Ctrl-A.

   Command Changes
   ---------------

   ==>    FOR:  Enabled extended parent directory names.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (General)
   -------------------------------------------------

   ==>    DESCRIPT.ION now allows either a space, tab, or comma as the
          delimiter between the filename and the description (for
          compatibility with some third-party description files).

   ==>    Fixed a problem with NUL characters in batch files.

   ==>    Fixed a minor problem with pipes of the form "prog1 | *prog2".

   ==>    Fixed a problem with files executed via executable extensions. 
          Double quotes are now added if the name contains whitespace.

   ==>    Fixed a sporadic problem with a ^C in DO if the DO test performed
          disk or keyboard I/O.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with redirection and NoClobber (NoClobber was
          effectively being ignored).

   ==>    The PATH search routine now queries if the specified drive is
          ready before attempting to find the external command, to avoid a
          critical error message.

   ==>    DO:  Now allows embedded equal signs in a test condition.

   ==>    FOR:  Fixed a problem with include lists in the FOR arguments.

   ==>    INPUT:  Fixed a problem with using INPUT /E in a transient shell
          and solved a problem with INPUT /W /E which prevented the
          existing value from being displayed unless you pressed a key.

   ==>    LIST:  Fixed a sporadic problem with Find with wrapping on.  Also
          improved LIST's ability to find the end of each line properly in
          files with unusual line terminations (e.g. CR or LF alone, LF/CR,
          CR/CR/LF, etc.).

   ==>    MD:  Fixed a problem with /S and UNC names.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (Windows 95) 
   ----------------------------------------------------

   ==>    4DOS now now strips quotes from the PATH string where required
          under Win95.  This is necessary for compatability with
          COMMAND.COM.

   ==>    Added support for the Win95 behavior of looking for WINBOOT.INI
          first for options like "BootGUI", then looking in MSDOS.SYS if
          WINBOOT.INI isn't found.

   ==>    Changed Win95 detection method.  This should avoid any cases
          where 4DOS confused Win95 with PC-DOS 7.0.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with AutoExecParms under a Command Prompt Only
          boot.

   ==>    Fixed a problem which was leaving the MSDOS.SYS file open after
          booting Win95 with BootGUI=1.

   ==>    Improved network support for long filenames in directory and
          filename completion.

   ==>    Worked around a Win95 bug with descriptions on an LFN drive (4DOS
          would occasionally display the wrong descriptions for some
          files).

   ==>    DESCRIBE:  Fixed a problem with placing the description on the
          command line (4DOS couldn't always tell if a quoted string was a
          description or a file name).  Also fixed a problem with wildcard
          DESCRIBEs under Win95 when the description was NOT included on
          the command line.

   ==>    LOCK / UNLOCK:  Enabled these commands in MS-DOS 7 (without the
          Win95 GUI loaded).
