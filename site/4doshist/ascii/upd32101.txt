   Check through this file for a comprehensive list of what's changed in
   Take Command/32 for Windows NT and Windows 95 since version 1.0. 
   Additional documentation on new features is in the online help.

   Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
   you aren't using a feature, feel free to skip to the next item.  If you
   are new to Take Command with version 1.01, you can skip this file
   entirely, and begin with the Introduction and Installation Guide.

   This file is divided into the following sections:

          General Features and Enhancements
          Startup and Initialization
          Menus and Dialogs
          Command Changes
          Variables and Variable Functions
          Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (each revision)

   Significant new features and those which affect most users are marked
   with "**" in the lists below.  Other items discuss smaller or more
   technical changes.

   This file may cover multiple revisions (e.g. version 5.51A, 5.51B,
   etc.).  Most items refer to changes made in the initial release,
   revision A.  Any item with a revision letter in the left margin (e.g. an
   item marked with "=>B") was added or updated in that revision.  Minor
   technical, compatibility, and bug fixes for each revision are listed at
   the end of the file.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the 4DOS LIST
   command, or printed on most PC printers using the command:

              copy updat101.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

                       Take Command/32 1.01 Change List


   General Features and Enhancements
   ---------------------------------

   => **  Updated Take Command/32 to improve operation of console-mode
          applications under Windows 95.  The console-mode window
          (accessible with Alt-V) is fixed at 50 lines in Windows 95,
          rather than the 100 lines used under Windows NT to provide a
          console-mode scrollback buffer (this is due to a bug in Windows
          95, not a limitation of Take Command/32).

   =>     Directory colorization now looks for the last '.' in the filename
          (rather than the first) to determine the extension for HPFS and
          NTFS files.

   =>     Added several new .INI directives:

              ListExit = Key (Esc):  Allows you to map the keystroke used
              to exit the LIST command.

     B        ConsoleColumns = nnnn (80).  Sets the width of the console
              mode screen buffer used for DOS and Win32 console
              applications.

     B        ConsoleRows = nnnn.  Sets the height of the console mode
              screen buffer used for DOS and Win32 console applications.

     B        HideConsole = [YES | No]:  If HideConsole is set to No, Take
              Command/32 won't hide the console window after running a DOS
              or Win32 console mode program.


   Menus and Dialogs
   -----------------

   => **  The Alias and Environment dialogs now copy the alias/environment
          list and perform all their work on the copy.  The changes are
          saved if you press the "OK" button, and discarded if you press
          "Cancel".  Previously each change was saved as it was made, so
          that Cancel would cancel only the most recent change.

   => **  The background color is now maintained separately for each
          process, so you can have multiple copies running without
          defaulting to the standard class color.

   =>     Added the I-Beam cursor setting (allows you to switch to an arrow
          cursor for laptops) to the Startup page of the configuration
          dialogs.  Previously this setting was only available via
          IBeamCursor=No in the .INI file.



   Take Command 1.01  [10-17-95] UPDAT101.DOC                        page 2


   =>     Take Command/32 will now search the path when executing a program
          from the Apps menu if no path is specified in the properties.

   =>     Enabled the "Wait for completion" option for external programs in
          the configuration dialogs (same as ExecWait = Yes in TCMD32.INI).


   Command Changes
   ---------------

   =>B ** ACTIVATE:  Added wildcard matching for the "window" parameter, so
          you can select a window even if you know only part of its name.

   => **  CLS:  Added a new switch, /C, to clear the entire scrollback
          buffer (CLS without /C clears only the visible portion of the
          window).

   => **  COPY / DEL / MOVE / REN:  When using the prompt (/P) option, an
          ESCAPE will now cancel further processing for that argument,
          rather than canceling prompting and continuing with the
          operation.

   =>B**  DIR:  Colorizing filenames with no extension wasn't specifically
          covered before, though you could do it by using "*:color" to
          color everything.  You can now specify files without extensions
          using the syntax " :color".  For example, the following ColorDir
          setting in the .INI file will color EXE files red, TXT files
          bright red, and files with no extension bright cyan:

                  ColorDir = exe:red;txt:bri red; :bri cya

   =>     GOSUB / GOTO:  Made a change to try to accommodate both the old
          label style (first word) and the new style that permits multi-
          word labels.

   =>     IFF:  Changed the way the command processor handles piping to
          IFF.  You can now pipe to an IFF and the pipe information will be
          passed to the command(s) following the IFF (previously it was
          ignored).

   =>     LIST:  Now defaults to listing (all files ("*.*") if the argument
          is a directory name.  Also printing the file now displays a
          header (filename, date, and time) on the first page, and GOTO now
          supports negative offsets -- for example you can enter "-10" to
          go back 10 lines.  When using negative offsets, the number of
          lines moved will not correspond accurately to the line count in
          the LIST status bar when the LIST display is wrapped.

   =>     ON:  Added a new ON ERRORMSG option.  ON ERRORMSG is the same as
          ON ERROR, but displays the usual error message before executing
          the specified command (ON ERROR suppresses the error message).




   Take Command 1.01  [10-17-95] UPDAT101.DOC                        page 3


   =>     SETDOS:  You can now change the default description filename with
          the SETDOS /D switch.  If the /D is followed by a double quote,
          the string inside the quotes will be used as the description
          file.  For example:

                  setdos /d"files.bbs"

          The SETDOS /D[0|1] switch (to disable or enable description
          processing) is still available.

   =>     TYPE:  Will now check for a filename of "NUL" and allow it. 
          However TYPE will trap attempts to type any other character
          device.


   Internal Variables and Variable Functions
   -----------------------------------------

   =>     Added two new internal variables:

              %_CI        returns the insert-mode cursor shape, as a
                          percentage (see SETDOS /S)

              %_CO        returns the overstrike-mode cursor shape, as a
                          percentage

   =>     Added support for the @INIREAD and @INIWRITE variable functions.

   =>     @ALTNAME:  If the specified filename is a FAT name (and doesn't
          have an alternate name), @ALTNAME now returns the original
          filename if the file exists, or an empty string if it does not. 
          Previously @ALTNAME always returned an empty string when the
          filename was already a FAT name with no alternate.

   =>     @ATTRIB:  Added an optional third argument.  The new syntax is
          %@ATTRIB[filename[,NRSHA[,p]]].  The 'p' tells ATTRIB to accept a
          partial match; i.e. if the file has "RHA" attributes set:

              %@ATTRIB[filename,R]         fails, because @ATTRIB wants an
                                           exact match

              %@ATTRIB[filename,R,p]  succeeds

   =>     @READSCR:  Added offset capability when "+" and "-" are used in
          the row and column (e.g., "READSCR[-2,0,10]").  The ofsset is
          relative to the current cursor position.

   =>     @TIMER:  Now separates the hundredths digits with the default
          country decimal character, not a hard-coded decimal point.

   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (1.01 rev A)
   ----------------------------------------------------

   => **  You can now remove extensions that Take Command loaded from the
          [Extensions] section of WIN.INI with the UNSET command.  If the
          name begins with a '.', UNSET will first look for an environment
          variable; if it doesn't find a matching one it will look in the
          list loaded from [Extensions].  UNSET will not modify WIN.INI, it
          will simply remove the extension from Take Command's internal
          copy of the WIN.INI associations.

   => **  Take Command/32 under Windows NT now searches for executables in
          \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 before \WINDOWS (this is the way Windows NT
          path searches work, but is the reverse of the way Win 3.x and
          Win95 work!).

   => **  Added a system menu and close box to the popup windows (history
          list, directory history, etc.).  These are required becuse the
          Esc key will not work in list boxes due to a Windows 95 bug (Esc
          does work properly under Windows NT).

   =>     The version number now uses the default decimal separator for the
          current country (e.g. "1,01" rather than "1.01" for Germany).

   =>     Worked around a Windows bug which caused trouble when you click
          on a toolbar button, move the mouse off the toolbar, then release
          the button.

   =>     Improved support for UNC names (network filenames starting with
          "\\"), particularly when changing the default directory.

   =>     Worked around a Netware bug which caused toruble with filename
          completion on Netware drives.

   =>     DIR, FFIND, SELECT:  Fixed a problem with a memory leak due to a
          Windows NT API bug.

   =>     IF:  Changed IF EXIST to work with "if exist c:\ ...", for
          compatibility with CMD.EXE.

   =>     KEYBD:  Worked around a Windows NT bug that was causing problems
          in the KEYBD command.

   =>     Added support for the "run in a separate Windows On Windows VM"
          flag when running programs from the Apps menu.

   =>     Changed the keyboard hook handler to fix problems with other
          keyboard hooks not working properly when Take Command was in the
          foreground.

   =>     Fixed a problem with the time display on the status bar being
          disabled after running an app inside Caveman.



   Take Command 1.01  [10-17-95] UPDAT101.DOC                        page 5


   =>     Fixed a problem with the Describe dialog if you changed drives -
          in this case directories and hidden files weren't being added to
          the Files listbox.

   =>     Fixed a a problem with starting an app minimized from the Apps
          menu.

   =>     Fixed a bug when clicking the left button in the Take Command
          window while it was displaying output.  Depending on where the
          click was, Take Command could reset its current output point and
          overwrite previous text.

   =>     Fixed a problem with the ? command only displaying the first word
          of the prompt.

   =>     Fixed a problem with long directory paths in the Describe dialog
          box.

   =>     Fixed a minor bug in UNKNOWN_CMD alias processing which caused
          the command processor to remove the command argument if it was
          (1) an existing file, and (2) not an executable file.

   =>     Fixed a problem with the File Find dialog resetting the Disk edit
          control after selecting an item from the Search group.

   =>     Fixed a problem with very long descriptions (over 500
          characters).

   =>     Fixed a problem with piping inside a batch file with arguments
          when a 4START file is loaded.

   =>     Fixed a problem with redirecting to "nul:".

   =>     Fixed a problem with the background color not being redrawn
          properly for the entire window.

   =>     Fixed a minor problem with command line colors when Ctrl-C was
          hit during input.

   =>     Fixed a problem with executing .PIF files. 

   =>     Fixed a problem where Take Command/32 would sometimes remove
          quotes from the startup command line when it shouldn't (it must
          remove leading and trailing quotes; it was also sometimes
          removing embedded quotes).

   =>     Fixed a problem with Take Command not always processing its
          message queue (for redraws, minimize/maximize, etc.) quickly when
          it was in a loop (particularly in DO loops).

   =>     Fixed a problem with popup windows (directory history, @SELECT,
          etc.) not accepting mouse double-clicks.



   Take Command 1.01  [10-17-95] UPDAT101.DOC                        page 6


   =>     Fixed a a problem with starting an application minimized from the
          Apps menu.

   =>     Several fixes for a variety of piping problems.

   =>     DESCRIBE:  Fixed a problem with clearing a description using the
          syntax:

                  describe file ""

   =>     DETACH:  Fixed a problem with detaching internal commands.

   =>     DO:  Fixed a problem with ITERATE inside nested IFFs inside DOs.

   =>     DRAWBOX:  Fixed a couple of problems with the cursor positioning
          and fill colors when the box was drawn over the current cursor
          position.  Also fixed a problem with the fill color being written
          one column too far to the right.

   =>     FFIND:  Fixed a problem which sometimes caused FFIND to loop
          endlessly printing blank lines; also fixed a problem with FFIND
          not searching past the first 64K of the file in a text search.

   =>     IF:  Now properly supports numeric comparisons when the current
          country uses a whitespace character (e.g., ',') as the decimal
          separator.

   =>     INKEY:  Fixed a problem with combining the /P and /K switches and
          then entering invalid input.

   =>     LIST:  Fixed a problem with LIST colors when you have a StdColors
          defined (different from the Windows default) and don't have a
          ListColors defined.

   =>     LIST:  Fixed problems with dragging the scrollbar thumbs, and
          with scrolling through extremely large files.

   =>     LIST:  Fixed a problem when scrolling backwards in files with
          lines longer than 65,520 characters.

   =>     SCRPUT / VSCRPUT:  Now preserve leading quoted whitespace in the
          text argument.

   =>     SELECT:  Fixed a problem when displaying files with very long
          descriptions (over 450 characters); also fixed a problem with
          flickering when moving the mouse.

   =>     UNSET:  Enabled UNSET * (previously it had no effect).

   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (1.01 rev B)
   ----------------------------------------------------

   =>     Modified the Alias and Environment dialogs to save new entries
          when you switch to another entry (previously you had to hit Enter
          in the value field to save a new entry).

   =>     Worked around a Windows NT and Windows 95 bug which caused
          problems with redirection to NUL.

   =>     Worked around Windows 95 bugs which ...

              Prevented Take Command from moving the console window to the
              top when Alt-V was pressed;

              Prevented Take Command from moving its own window to the top;

              Kept Windows 95 from shutting down with a Take Command/32
              window open;

              Killed Take Command/32 if the console window was closed
              manually (it now cannot be closed manually);

              Caused confusion if you deleted the current Take Command/32
              directory from another program;

              Disabled long directory names after running an old DOS
              program that didn't support them; and

              Caused Take Command/32 to display an incorrect Win95 build
              number.

   =>     Added support for expanding variables in the command line in
          program manager items in the Apps menu.  If you have items with
          command lines like %WINSYSDIR%\APPNAME.EXE they should now work
          correctly.

   =>     Fixed a problem with pasting long lines from the clipboard to the
          command line.

   =>     Fixed a problem with long filenames in the TCSTART / TCEXIT path.

   =>     Fixed a problem with long filenames in the LOG /W path.

   =>     %_DPMI:  Changed to use the country-dependent decimal character.

   =>     %_WINVER:  Changed to use the country-dependent decimal
          character.

   =>     DIR / SELECT:  Now display a blank date and time for any file
          with a date and time of exactly 0.




   Take Command 1.01  [10-17-95] UPDAT101.DOC                        page 8


   =>     DIR:  Fixed a problem with 0-byte files on FAT drives being
          displayed as using one disk cluster (instead of 0 clusters).

   =>     FFIND:  Fixed a problem with not clearing the hex flag after a
          previous LIST /X.

   =>     GOSUB / GOTO:  Now search for labels starting at the current
          position and working toward the end of the file, then restart the
          search at the beginning of the file if necessary (for
          compatibility with Windows NT CMD.EXE).

   =>     LIST:  Fixed a problem with marking lines longer than 511
          characters.

   =>     QUIT:  Fixed a problem with running "QUIT n" from the command
          line.

   =>     SELECT:  Fixed a problem with page numbering in the SELECT
          display.
