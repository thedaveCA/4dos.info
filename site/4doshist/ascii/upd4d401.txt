                           4DOS Update Documentation

                         Version 4.01 -- June 8, 1992

   This file provides a list of changes in 4DOS versions 4.0 and 4.01.  It
   is included with 4DOS 4.02 for users of earlier versions who wish to
   have a complete change history, and is not needed for any other reason. 
   If you are new to 4DOS with version 4.02, you can skip this file.

   At the end of this file there is information about some of the major
   changes made between 4DOS versions 3 and 4.  You should review this
   information if you are upgrading from 4DOS version 3 to version 4.01,
   and have never used 4DOS 4.0.

   Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
   you aren't using the feature described, feel free to skip through to the
   next item!

   Probably most of the changes in version 4.01 won't affect you.  For
   changes which affect or are likely to be useful to most users, look for
   the dew changes marekd with a "**" below.  All changes without a "**"
   are more technical or less important; you can skip them unless you are
   trying to solve a specific problem, or looking for changes which may
   affect your batch files, aliases, or another specific feature you use.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the 4DOS LIST
   command, or printed on most PC printers using the command:

            copy readme.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

                             4DOS 4.01 Change List


   General Features
   ----------------

      ** Include lists can be up to 255 characters long (the previous limit
      was 79 characters).

      ** External applications can now be invoked with extended parent
      directory names ("...\appname").

      ** Drive changes will now save the old drive and directory so it can
      be retrieved with a "CDD -".

      A new 4DOS.INI directive, DescriptionMax = nnnn, now controls the
      description length limit for DESCRIBE (the previous limit was fixed
      at 40 characters).  This will provide better support for 3rd-party
      description editors which support longer descriptions.  The default
      for DescriptionMax is 40 characters; the allowable range is 20 to 120
      characters.  DESCRIBE will also allow editing of descriptions longer
      than DescriptionMax, but such descriptions cannot be lengthened. 
      Descriptions displayed by DIR and SELECT are truncated at the screen
      width, with a right arrow at the end if the full description doesn't
      fit on the screen.

      Lines in SET /R and ALIAS /R files, and aliases and variables edited
      by ESET, editing lines can all be up to 511 characters long.

      The "Cancel batch file?" prompt is now sent to STDERR rather than
      STDOUT, in case batch output is redirected.

      Prefacing an external command with a '@' will remove the old value of
      CMDLINE from the environment.  For folks who want to keep the
      environment small when loading TSRs.

      KSTACK has been rewritten with a different internal implementation. 
      The external use is the same for both users (the KEYSTACK command)
      and programmers (the API for KSTACK).  The new version will not eat
      up CPU time in DESQview windows the way the old one did.  Also some
      minor problems have been fixed, and KSTACK now releases its
      environment block at startup.

      4DOS now displays the true INI file name when an error occurs
      (previously "4DOS.INI" was displayed reagrdless of the actual name).

      Variable expansion will now work when the variable is within an alias
      and is embedded in the first item on the line.  For example:






   4DOS 4.01  [6-8-92]           UPDAT401.DOC                        page 2


            c:\> alias mycopy=copy /r
            c:\> set xx=py
            c:\> myco%xx file1 a:

      will copy file1 to drive A:, and prompt if the destination file
      already exists.

      Added a new 4DOS startup switch, /K.  This switch does nothing, but
      all text after it is treated like a command, so using "/K command" at
      the end of the 4DOS command line is equivalent to including the
      "command" without /K.  This is equivalent to the 4OS2 /K switch, and
      is included for compatibility with the version of COMMAND.COM
      distributed with OS/2 2.0.  You can use either /K or /C before the
      command, but not both.

      Several internal changes were made to provide better support for
      using 4DOS in OS/2 2.0 DOS sessions.


   Internal Variables and Variable Functions
   -----------------------------------------

      %_DISK no longer generates a physical disk access.

      %@ASCII[] now checks for an escape character preceding the actual
      character to process.  This allows quotes and other special
      characters as the argument (eg %@ASCII[^X`]).

      %@FILESIZE now returns -1 on a non-existent file.

      %@SELECT now supports input from CON (standard input).

      Changed %@WORD to disable the / as a separator; now it will only use
      spaces, tabs, and commas.


   Commands
   --------

      ** ATTRIB:  Now has a /P(ause) switch to make it easier to display
      attributes for groups of files.

      CALL:  Now returns an exit code (%_?) which matches the batch file
      exit code.  This allows the use of conditionals (&& and ||) after
      CALL based on the batch file's exit code (eg from QUIT n) rather than
      whether the CALL command worked.

      COPY and MOVE:  When performed from an OS/2 session, these will now
      copy OS/2 extended attributes if the target file system supports
      them.  Also, /U and /R switches will now search for hidden and system
      files on the target.




   4DOS 4.01  [6-8-92]           UPDAT401.DOC                        page 3


      DEL:  Now sets the internal error level (%_?) non-zero if no files
      were deleted.

      ECHOS:  Output is now in binary "raw" mode (without CR to CRLF
      conversion etc.) to assist those using it to echo printer control
      strings.

      IF and IFF:  Integer tests (i.e., "if 5 lt 12") have been modified to
      allow for - and +, so you can now test things like "if -1 lt 1".

      INKEY:  Now translates the Enter key to its scan code (@28) to
      simplify detection of this keystroke.  Previously Enter was put into
      the environment as an ASCII 13, which wouldn't display, and which
      would be discarded as whitespace when the parser expanded the
      variable.

      PROMPT:  Has a new symbol:  $r displays the return code of the last
      command.  This is for compatibility with COMMAND.COM under OS/2 2.0
      which also provides this feature.

      SETDOS:  Has a new /P switch to set the character used to specify all
      or all remaining command line arguments.  The default is '&' (as in
      "%&") for 4DOS and '$' (as in "%$") for 4OS2.  Use (for example)
      SETDOS /P$ to set the 4DOS character to match 4OS2.  Also see the
      ParameterChar directive below.

      UNALIAS and UNSET:  Have a new /Q(uiet) option to disable error
      messages if the alias or variable does not exist.  This can be used
      to avoid annoying error messages from batch files which clear
      variables or aliases that may not be defined.

      VER:  Now reports DR-DOS and OS/2 version numbers and revision levels
      when they are available.


   Technical and Compatibility Changes
   -----------------------------------

      DR-DOS:  Added a DIREXIST condition (same as ISDIR) to IF and IFF for
      compatibility with DR-DOS 6 batch files.

      OS/2:  4DOS will now search the true boot drive (as opposed to the
      current drive) for AUTOEXEC and other similar files when starting a
      primary shell in DOS 4 and above.  This should allow AUTOEXEC to run
      properly in OS/2 2.0 VDMs when starting the VDM on a drive different
      from the boot drive.  Also, 4DOS changes the session title on the
      OS/2 desktop to the name of the application program when running an
      application in an OS/2 2.0 DOS session.  This behavior can be
      disabled with the ChangeTitle directive (see below).  






   4DOS 4.01  [6-8-92]           UPDAT401.DOC                        page 4


      Novell Netware:  Worked around a Netware bug which allows the current
      directory to be deleted (and loses the disk mapping) when 4DOS does a
      DEL /X.

      The prompt interrupt (INT 2F, AX=D44E) is now issued just after a
      line is read (ie just after the CR), with BX=2.  This is in addition
      to the interrupts already done with BX=0 and 1 per appendix C of the
      manual.

      4DOS now allows multiple processes to redirect output to NUL
      simultaneously in multitaskers.

      4DOS now generates a "4DOS internal stack overflow" error if you
      attempt to nest batch files or commands like EXCEPT, FOR, IF, IFF,
      GLOBAL, or SELECT too deep, and 4DOS runs out of stack space.  In the
      past 4DOS could hang the system under these conditions.

      The default stack size (set via the StackSize directive in 4DOS.INI)
      has been increased from 3584 to 4096 bytes.

      Added the following new INI file directives.  Most of these
      directives are advanced directives, and should be changed only to
      solve unusual problems or for compatibility with the indicated
      software (eg NetwareNames for Novell Netware, or ParameterChar to
      make 4DOS and 4OS2 syntax the same).

         ChangeTitle = YES | No:  Determines whether 4DOS changes the OS/2
         session title when running an external program from an OS/2 2.0
         DOS session.

         CopyEA = YES | No:  Determines whether the 4DOS COPY and MOVE
         commands attempt to copy extended attributes when running in an
         OS/2 1.x or 2.0 DOS session.  

         DiskReset = Yes | NO:  Enables or disables disk resets after COPY,
         MOVE, and RENAME, and before DIR.  Set to Yes if you have problems
         with disk change detection on non-standard or cached floppy disk
         drives, or with network software which doesn't always properly
         flush data to the disk.  However such problems are VERY rare and
         normally No is the best choice.  Setting DiskReset to Yes will
         reduce the performance of DIR, COPY, MOVE, and RENAME when using a
         "staged-write" disk cache such as SmartDrive 4.0.

         DRSets = YES | No.  When running under DR-DOS, 4DOS will normally
         retrieve environment variables created by any SET commands in the
         DR-DOS CONFIG.SYS file and place them in the 4DOS master
         environment.  Set DRSets to No to disable this feature.

         DVCleanup = YES | No.  No disables 4DOS's DESQview close window
         cleanup code and thereby reenables the Quit choice on the DESQview
         menu when at a 4DOS prompt.  However this will prevent 4DOS from
         cleaning up its resources (releasing the shell number and deleting



   4DOS 4.01  [6-8-92]           UPDAT401.DOC                        page 5


         any disk swap file) when you Close a 4DOS window from the DESQview
         menu, rather than with the EXIT command.

         NetwareNames = Yes | NO.  Set to Yes to include strings in the
         resident portion of 4DOS which Netware searches for when it loads. 
         NetwareNames should be set to Yes for Netware systems to avoid
         problems with destroyed environment variables during LOGIN. 
         CAUTION:  If NetwareNames is set to Yes and you BOOT FROM a
         Netware drive (a rare situation), the TEMP4DOS or TEMP variables
         must be SET explicitly to the appropriate drive and directory for
         each user to avoid conflicts in the directory used for pipe files
         (if NetwareNames is not used or you boot from a local drive, 4DOS
         and Netware will automatically set the proper drive and directory
         for pipe files).

         NextINIFile = File.  Full path and name must be specified.  All
         subsequent shells will read the specified INI file, and ignore any
         [Secondary] section in the original 4DOS.INI.  Intended to allow
         diskless or floppy-only workstation users to shift 4DOS.INI to a
         network drive for secondary shells, and avoid all access to the
         original boot drive.

         ParameterChar = c.  Sets the character used to specify all or all
         remaining command line arguments.  Default is '&' (as in "%&") for
         4DOS and '$' (as in "%$") for 4OS2.  Also see SETDOS /P above.

         UniqueSwapName = Yes | No.  Set to Yes to change the disk swap
         file name from 4DOSSWAP.nnn to a unique name generated by 4DOS,
         with an extension of "4SW" (eg a1gd6nnw.4sw).  This prevents
         conflicts between swap files in different shells; it is only
         necessary when using disk swapping with a COMMAND.COM primary
         shell (eg if using Software Carousel) or in an OS/2 2.0 DOS
         session.  The default is Yes in OS/2 2.0 DOS sessions and No
         elsewhere.  UniqueSwapName only works in DOS 3.0 and above and
         applies only to disk swapping.


   Bugs Fixed
   ----------

      Initialization:

         ** The sense of the MessageServer directive in 4DOS.INI was
         reversed.

         The /F startup switch did not work unless there was also a
         CritFail=Yes in 4DOS.INI.

      Command Line:

         Ctrl-D in a history window did not work properly when using
         command completion.



   4DOS 4.01  [6-8-92]           UPDAT401.DOC                        page 6


         An F8 or Shift-Tab at the beginning of a command line didn't
         preserve the trailing backslash for directory names from a
         previous F9 or Tab.

         Key remapping for standard ASCII keys (e.g. ListFind=S) only
         worked if upper case key was typed.

      Environment Variables, Variable Functions, Batch Files, and Aliases:

         Command grouping had a glitch when used after a conditional
         operator (&& or ||).

         Batch variables of %10 and larger were not expanding correctly.

         Variable expansion had trouble when used following a leading
         command group [e.g. (dir^memory) > %outfile].

         Variable expansion crashed when an environment variable argument
         was over 255 characters long.

         @DATE:  Did not work correctly with non-US date entries (i.e.,
         yy-mm-dd or dd-mm-yy).

         @FILESIZE:  Was not rounding properly when the k, K, m, or M units
         were used.

         @SELECT:  Was allowing Ctrl-D but it did not work.  It is no
         longer allowed.  Also %@SELECT had trouble with 0-length files and
         very large (>64K) files.

      Commands:

         CANCEL:  Was failing to terminate succeeding commands on the same
         line in a parent batch file.

         COPY:  Was not handling an append of the form COPY FU+NUL FU /B
         properly.

         COPY and MOVE:  Would lose the first description if the target
         file had a description and the source didn't.

         DEL:  /Q was not doing a fast (FCB-style) delete.

         FOR:  (@filename) did not work correctly with long lines (>=80
         characters).  The maximum line length now is 255 characters.

         INKEY:  /K didn't work properly with variable names over 6
         characters.

         LIST:  /S had problems with very large (>64K) files when you hit
         an invalid key.

         MEMORY:  did not display available XMS in an OS/2 2.0 VDM.

         MOVE:  /D didn't work properly with multiple source arguments. 
         Also MOVE did not preserve the read-only bit when moving a file to
         another drive.

                          Changes in 4DOS Version 4.0

   This section contains information about major changes made in 4DOS
   version 4.0.  This is not a complete description of what was new in 4DOS
   4.0 -- it only includes significant changes you may need to be aware of
   if you are upgrading from 4DOS version 3 to version 4.01, and have never
   used 4DOS 4.0.  For details on any specific feature, see your manual and
   the MANMOD.DOC file.  If you need a comprehensive list of changes in
   4DOS 4.0, please contact JP Software.


   Installation and Configuration 
   ------------------------------

      4DOS.COM:  4DOS is now one file, 4DOS.COM.  The separate 4DOS88.EXE
      or 4DOS286.EXE files in the old structure have been eliminated.

      4DOS.INI:  There is a wide variety of new startup options for 4DOS,
      and 4DOS configuration is now controlled through the new 4DOS.INI
      file, for both primary and secondary shells.  Some switches can also
      still be set on the SHELL= line in CONFIG.SYS.

      UMBs:  4DOS can now load its resident portion and / or the master
      environment into DOS 5 UMBs.  UMB access is requested with the
      UMBLoad and UMBEnvironment directives in 4DOS.INI.

      KEYSTACK:  The KEYSTACK.SYS device driver was replaced by KSTACK.COM,
      a TSR (memory-resident program), normally loaded from AUTOEXEC.BAT
      (or with INSTALL= in CONFIG.SYS).


   4DOS HELP System
   ----------------

      The help program was renamed 4HELP.EXE to avoid conflicts with other
      HELP.EXE programs.  This program is run when F1 is pressed at the
      command line or when the HELP command is executed.  The help text
      file is now 4DOS.HLP (for those with a utility disk, the ASCII text
      file is 4DOS.TXT).  The 4HELP, 4HELPF, and 4HELPC environment
      variables were removed and replaced by the 4DOS.INI directives
      HelpPath and HelpOptions.

      The new HELP system is not compatible with the version 3.0 HELP
      system; if you have modified the version 3.0 HELP text you must
      purchase a version 4.0 Utility Disk and recompile your help text to
      use it with 4DOS 4.0 HELP.

      HELPCFG now supports a /M switch to force it to run in monochrome
      mode and adjust the monochrome HELP colors, even on color systems. 
      Also the HELPCFG exit keys were changed to conform to general usage
      standards.

   Batch File Commands
   -------------------

   A few commands were changed in ways that may require you to edit your
   batch files or aliases if they use the earlier syntax.

      DIR Switches:  Several switches were changed for DOS 5 compatibility. 
      DIR now supports the DOS 5 sort order switches (/O:[-degns]), as well
      as the original 4DOS switches (/O:[eirtuz]).  A byproduct of the
      switch changes is that the /A:xxxx and /O:xxxx switches CANNOT be
      followed by another parameter without an intervening slash.  For
      example, you used to be able to say DIR /OEP to display the directory
      in extension order with pauses.  You must now use DIR /OE/P or DIR
      /POE.

      IF and IFF Tests:  Most of the old tests for system resources (EMS,
      XMS, DISKFREE, etc.) were moved to variable functions to make the
      information available throughout 4DOS rather than just in IF and IFF. 
      In addition, some new tests were added, as well as new .AND., .OR.,
      and .XOR. conditional operators.  

            Old IF / IFF test       New Variable or Variable Function
            -----------------       ---------------------------------
               MONITOR              %_MONITOR
               VIDEO                %_VIDEO
               ATTRIB               %@ATTRIB[filename,attrib]
               DISKFREE             %@DISKFREE[d:,b|k|m]
               DOSMEM               %@DOSMEM[b|k|m]
               EMS                  %@EMS[b|k|m]
               EXTENDED             %@EXTENDED[b|k|m]
               FILESIZE             %@FILESIZE[filename,b|k|m]
               XMS                  %@XMS[b|k|m]

      Include Lists:  The separator character for "include lists" was
      changed from a plus sign to a semicolon.  Also, while in 4DOS 3.03
      they were available only for the DIR and SELECT commands, in version
      4.0 include lists were extended to all 4DOS file processing commands. 

      SET:  The syntax was changed to match COMMAND.COM:  You MUST enter an
      '=' in a SET statement, and you may now put whitespace in the
      variable name or the argument.  Also, if you enter SET VARNAME with
      nothing else on the line SET will now display the value of the
      variable, rather than removing it from the environment as it used to. 
      To remove an environment variable, you must add the "=" sign to the
      end (e.g. SET VARNAME=), or use UNSET.  Also note that, because
      whitespace in environment variable names and values is now preserved,
      batch files with lines like "SET MYVAR = MYVALUE" may not work unless
      they are changed to eliminate the extra spaces.  Under 4DOS 3.03 this
      example would set "MYVAR" to "MYVALUE"; under 4DOS 4.0 it will set

      change to the master environment, instead of the local one.
