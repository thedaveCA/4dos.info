                 Patch Documentation -- April 16, 1999

This patch updates:

   From:   TCMD OS/2 v2.02 rev B (build 130)
   To:     TCMD OS/2 v2.02 rev B (build 131)

This file explains how to install the patch.

To use this patch, you must have:

     * JP Software's PATCH.EXE program.  PATCH.EXE is distributed in a
       separate file, JPPATCH.ZIP, and is available on our Internet FTP
       site and in our CompuServe file area (see below for details).

     * A copy of TCMD OS/2 2.02 rev B (build 130).

       The simplest way to check your revision and build number is to
       use use the VER /R command.

To use this patch, copy the TCO2131.RTP file to the directory where
your TCMD OS/2 version 2.02 (130) files are stored.

Make sure JP Software's PATCH.EXE is in the same directory, or in a
directory on your PATH, then enter the command:

      patch TCO2131

This patch modifies the following files:

          TCMDOS2.EXE

Any branding (name and serial number) information will be preserved in
the modified files.  If any of the files are missing the patch program
will continue without patching them.

If you want to test TCMD OS/2 to make sure the patch worked, restart the
program and then use the VER /R command.  After the patch is complete
VER /R should report version 2.02B (131).


The changes in this revision / build include:

   Bugs Fixed
   ----------

     * Take Command (all versions) would hang when sounding beeps for
       shareware timing reminders.

     * The (invalid) command "CD ,," would crash 4NT in some instances,
       and could theoretically have crashed other products (though there
       are no reports of such problems).

     * The (unsupported) command SET /M would crash Take Command/32 in
       some instances.

If this patch updates the help file (see the file list above) you can
also review this change list in the "What's New" section of the online
help, under "Bugs Fixed", after the patch is completed.
