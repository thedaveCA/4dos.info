This file explains how to install the Take Command 1.0 rev B patch.

To use the patch, you must have:

     * JP Software's PATCH.EXE program.  This program is in a separate
     file, PATCH.ZIP on CompuServe, or 4DPATCH.ZIP on bulletin boards
     and the Internet.  [* See note below.]

     * A copy of Take Command 1.0 rev A.  The simplest way to check your
     revision level is to use the Take Command VER /R command.

To use this patch, copy the TCMD10A.RTP file to the directory where your
Take Command version 1.0 files are stored.  Make sure you are NOT using
the copy of TCMD.EXE that you want to patch (under some conditions Windows
may not allow you to modify a file while that file is in use).  You can
run the patch from a 4DOS or COMMAND.COM session, exit Windows and run the
patch, or make a copy of TCMD.EXE and patch the copy.

Make sure JP Software's PATCH.EXE is in the same directory as TCMD.EXE,
or in a directory on your PATH, then enter the command:

      patch tcmd10b

This patch converts Take Command 1.0 rev A to version 1.0 rev B.  It
modifies TCMD.EXE, TC16DLL.DLL, CAVEMAN.386, and TCMD.HLP.  All other files
are unchanged from rev A.  Branding (name and serial number) information in
your TCMD.EXE file will be preserved in the modified file.

If you have copied any of these files to other locations be sure you copy
the updated files to those locations as well.  For example, if you are
using Take Command as your Windows shell you probably have a copy of
TC16DLL.DLL in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory; in this case the updated
TC16DLL.DLL must be copied to that directory as well.

If you want to test TCMD.EXE to make sure the patch worked, restart Take
Command, then use the VER /R command.  This command will report "Take
Command Revision A" (if the patch did not work) or "Take Command Revision
B" (if it did work).

If you are short on disk space and receive a message that there is not
enough space to perform the patch, you can use a command like this to
reduce the disk space required:

      patch /noundo tcmd10b

This will make recovery slightly more difficult in the unlikely event of
a power failure or similar problem during the patch process, but will
reduce the disk space required to perform the patch.


[* JP Software's PATCH.EXE is the version 1.10 patch program from the
.RTPatch patch software sold by PocketSoft Inc.  If you have a copy of
PATCH.EXE version 1.10 or later from another company which also uses
.RTPatch to update its software, you can use it with JP Software
patches. However, we recommend that you do NOT use version 2.0 of
PATCH.EXE under OS/2.  When PATCH.EXE 2.0 is used under OS/2 it patches
the files properly, but does not correctly update the dates and times of
the patched files.]


Take Command version 1.0 rev B includes the following changes to version
1.0 rev A:

Command Input and Editing Changes:

     * Fixed a bug in resizing the history list from the Configure Take
       Command dialog.

     * Fixed a problem with Ctrl-Shift-Tab (the "append next matching"
       key).

     * Fixed a problem with redefining the History and @SELECT window
       keys.

     * Worked around a Windows bug which caused trouble assigning F11
       and F12 to keystroke aliases.


General Feature Changes:

     * Changed the version string to use the country-defined decimal
       character, so IF tests on the version level will work properly.

     * Comparisons like "if %_date == 12-20-94 ..."  now work as they
       did in 5.0. Note that even though these tests now work, this
       approach is not recommended.  To test two strings quotes should
       be used around the strings. Otherwise the fact that the strings
       begin with digits may cause them to be interpreted as numbers.

     * Fixed a problem with an @@ key alias turning off echoing for
       subsequent @ key aliases.

     * Fixed a problem with numeric color names with values greater than
       7 when BRI or BLI was not used).  Also, the "ON" is now optional.

     * Fixed a problem with numeric comparisons where one had a decimal
       component and the other didn't (e.g., "if 2 == 2.0").

     * Fixed a problem with TCMD not enforcing a 127-character limit on
       session titles.

     * Made some minor changes to allow other Windows applications to be
       more responsive when Take Command is doing heavy disk crunching.

     * TCMD now uses only 1 system timer.  Previously it used two; if
       you were seriously short of spare timers you might end up with
       Caveman not ever updating its screen.


Variable and Function Changes:

     * @ALIAS: Now truncates aliases greater than the maximum line size
       (255 in DOS, 1023 in OS/2 & NT) to avoid line length errors.

     * @ATTRIB: Fixed a problem with not matching against all the
       specified attributes.

     * @EVAL: Fixed a problem which was truncating the returned value.

     * @FILEREAD in binary mode will now properly terminate the input
       string.

     * @INT and @NUMERIC now do more exhaustive testing.

     * @INIREAD:  Fixed a problem INIREAD when the last argument was
       more than one word, for example:

          %@iniread[c:\windows\control.ini,current,color scheme]


Batch File Changes:

     * Fixed a problem with ESC not working with SETDOS /Y1 (the ESC
       should have been equivalent to an 'R').

     * Fixed a problem with the batch file line (used in error messages)
       not getting updated inside command groups or line continuations
       (where the previous line ended in an escape character).


Windows- and Caveman-related Changes

     * Changed the time-of-day clock on the status bar to include a
       seconds count (updated every two seconds).

     * Fixed a problem which would cause an EXIT in a secondary copy of
       Take Command to close other Windows applications when Take
       Command was defined as the Windows shell.

     * Fixed a problem with Caveman apps not displaying properly after
       killing the previous one from the Apps menu.

     * Fixed a problem with describing directories in the Describe
       dialog.

     * Improved Caveman compatibility with some programs which use INT
       10 functions 10, 11, and 12.


Command Changes:

     * ?:  Fixed a problem with a "?..." command being executed even if
       it was inside an IFF block where the condition was false.  Also
       fixed a problem when the command following a "?" was an alias.

     * ?:  The "?" command can now be redirected or piped; using
       redirection or piping will no longer cause "?" to be interpreted
       as a batch prompt command.

     * ACTIVATE: fixed a problem with ACTIVATE CLOSE with certain
       programs.

     * ACTIVATE: Worked around a Windows bug when you try to find or
       activate a window with no title (e.g., ACTIVATE "").

     * ALIAS: Added a check for UNKNOWN_CMD alias loops.

     * DIR: Fixed two case problems with SETDOS /U1 and the /F and /L
       switches.

     * DO: Fixed an obscure problem if you do a LEAVE in a DO UNTIL, in
       the same loop pass where DO would have terminated anyway.

     * DRAWBOX: Slowed down the ZOOM option on fast systems so you can
       actually see it.

     * EXCEPT: Fixed a problem with ranges.

     * FFIND: Fixed a bug where FFIND would loop endlessly if there was
       a match on the last line of a file, with no terminating CR/LF,
       and a bug in the /E option.  Also, FFIND will no longer return
       the "." and ".." directories.

     * LIST: Now supports files with CR's only (no LF's).  LIST should
       now display files properly whether lines are terminated by CR,
       LF, or CR/LF.  Also LIST now updates the status bar (date and
       time) while LIST is active.

     * SCRPUT: Fixed a minor glitch when displaying a character past the
       current cursor position on the current line.

     * SELECT: Enabled the + and - keys; fixed a problem with calling up
       LIST within SELECT, then hitting ^C in LIST and again when you
       return to SELECT; and fixed an occasional problem with garbage on
       the SELECT header line after doing a LIST from within SELECT.

     * TEE and Y:  Fixed problems when you didn't specify any arguments
       (this isn't exactly invalid syntax, but isn't exactly useful
       either).
