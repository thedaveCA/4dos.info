   Check through this file for a comprehensive list of what's changed in
   Take Command/16 for Windows 3.x since version 1.0.  Additional
   documentation on new features is in the online help.

   Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
   you aren't using a feature, feel free to skip to the next item.  If you
   are new to Take Command with version 1.01, you can skip this file
   entirely, and begin with the Introduction and Installation Guide.

   This file is divided into the following sections:

          General Features and Enhancements
          Startup and Initialization
          Menus and Dialogs
          Command Changes
          Variables and Variable Functions
          Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (each revision)

   Significant new features and those which affect most users are marked
   with "**" in the lists below.  Other items discuss smaller or more
   technical changes.

   This file may cover multiple revisions (e.g. version 1.01A, 1.01B,
   etc.).  Most items refer to changes made in the initial release,
   revision A.  Any item with a revision letter in the left margin (e.g. an
   item marked with "=>B") was added or updated in that revision.  Minor
   technical, compatibility, and bug fixes for each revision are listed at
   the end of the file.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the LIST
   command, or printed on most PC printers using the command:

              copy updat101.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

                       Take Command/16 1.01 Change List


   General Features and Enhancements
   ---------------------------------

   => **  Take Command/16 now supports beta versions of Windows 95
          including long filenames and the LOCK and UNLOCK commands. 
          However we recommend use of Take Command/32, not Take Command/16,
          under Windows 95.


   Startup and Initialization
   --------------------------

   =>     Added two new .INI directives:

              PromptShellExit = Yes | NO:  Specify whether to prompt when
              exiting if Take Command is the Windows shell.  This applies
              to the EXIT command, Alt-F4, and the "Exit" option in the
              File menu.   This option is not available in the
              configuration dialogs.

     B        TCMDTaskList = YES | No:  If "no", disables the internal Take
              Command task list manager called up by Ctrl-Esc, and uses the
              Windows default instead.


   Menus and Dialogs
   -----------------

   => **  The Alias and Environment dialogs now copy the alias/environment
          list and perform all their work on the copy.  The changes are
          saved if you press the "OK" button, and discarded if you press
          "Cancel".  Previously each change was saved as it was made, so
          that Cancel would cancel only the most recent change.

   => **  The background color is now maintained separately for each
          process, so you can have multiple copies running without
          defaulting to the standard class color.

   =>     Added the I-Beam cursor setting (allows you to switch to an arrow
          cursor for laptops) to the Startup page of the configuration
          dialogs.  Previously this setting was only available via
          IBeamCursor=No in the .INI file.

   Command Changes
   ---------------

   =>B ** ACTIVATE:  Added wildcard matching for the "window" parameter, so
          you can select a window even if you know only part of its name.

   => **  CLS:  Added a new switch, /C, to clear the entire scrollback
          buffer (CLS without /C clears only the visible portion of the
          window).

   => **  COPY / DEL / MOVE / REN:  When using the prompt (/P) option, an
          ESCAPE will now cancel further processing for that argument,
          rather than canceling prompting and continuing with the
          operation.

   =>B**  DIR:  Colorizing filenames with no extension wasn't specifically
          covered before, though you could do it by using "*:color" to
          color everything.  You can now specify files without extensions
          using the syntax " :color".  For example, the following ColorDir
          setting in the .INI file will color EXE files red, TXT files
          bright red, and files with no extension bright cyan:

                  ColorDir = exe:red;txt:bri red; :bri cya

   =>     GOSUB / GOTO:  Made a change to try to accommodate both the old
          label style (first word) and the new style that permits multi-
          word labels.

   =>     IFF:  Changed the way the command processor handles piping to
          IFF.  You can now pipe to an IFF and the pipe information will be
          passed to the command(s) following the IFF (previously it was
          ignored).

   =>B    LIST:  Now defaults to listing (all files ("*.*") if the argument
          is a directory name.  Also printing the file now displays a
          header (filename, date, and time) on the first page, and GOTO now
          supports negative offsets -- for example you can enter "-10" to
          go back 10 lines.  When using negative offsets, the number of
          lines moved will not correspond accurately to the line count in
          the LIST status bar when the LIST display is wrapped.

   =>     ON:  Added a new ON ERRORMSG option.  ON ERRORMSG is the same as
          ON ERROR, but displays the usual error message before executing
          the specified command (ON ERROR suppresses the error message).

   =>     SETDOS:  You can now change the default description filename with
          the SETDOS /D switch.  If the /D is followed by a double quote,
          the string inside the quotes will be used as the description
          file.  For example:

                  setdos /d"files.bbs"




   Take Command 1.01  [10-17-95] UPDAT101.DOC                        page 3


          The SETDOS /D[0|1] switch (to disable or enable description
          processing) is still available.

   =>     TYPE:  Will now check for a filename of "NUL" and allow it. 
          However TYPE will trap attempts to type any other character
          device.


   Internal Variables and Variable Functions
   -----------------------------------------

   =>     Added two new internal variables:

              %_CI        returns the insert-mode cursor shape, as a
                          percentage (see SETDOS /S)

              %_CO        returns the overstrike-mode cursor shape, as a
                          percentage

   =>     @ATTRIB:  Added an optional third argument.  The new syntax is
          %@ATTRIB[filename[,NRSHA[,p]]].  The 'p' tells ATTRIB to accept a
          partial match; i.e. if the file has "RHA" attributes set:

              %@ATTRIB[filename,R]         fails, because @ATTRIB wants an
                                           exact match

              %@ATTRIB[filename,R,p]       succeeds

   =>     @READSCR:  Added offset capability when "+" and "-" are used in
          the row and column (e.g., "READSCR[-2,0,10]").  The ofsset is
          relative to the current cursor position.

   =>     @TIMER:  Now separates the hundredths digits with the default
          country decimal character, not a hard-coded decimal point.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (1.01 rev A)
   ----------------------------------------------------

   => **  You can now remove extensions that Take Command loaded from the
          [Extensions] section of WIN.INI with the UNSET command.  If the
          name begins with a '.', UNSET will first look for an environment
          variable; if it doesn't find a matching one it will look in the
          list loaded from [Extensions].  UNSET will not modify WIN.INI, it
          will simply remove the extension from Take Command's internal
          copy of the WIN.INI associations.

   =>     The version number now uses the default decimal separator for the
          current country (e.g. "1,01" rather than "1.01" for Germany).






   Take Command 1.01  [10-17-95] UPDAT101.DOC                        page 4


   =>     Worked around a Windows bug which caused trouble when you click
          on a toolbar button, move the mouse off the toolbar, then release
          the button.

   =>     Added a minor fix to skip the mouse position arguments that
          Windows passes when you define Take Command as the Task Manager
          replacement.

   =>     Worked around a Windows bug that was causing problems when
          creating unique filenames for pipes.

   => **  Made several changes to fix problems with DOS applications
          running under Caveman where the Caveman window is smaller than
          the Take Command window.

   => **  Changed the keyboard hook handler to fix problems with other
          keyboard hooks not working properly when Take Command was in the
          foreground.

   =>     Fixed a problem with the time display on the status bar being
          disabled after running an app inside Caveman.

   =>     Fixed a problem with the Describe dialog if you changed drives --
          in this case directories and hidden files weren't being added to
          the Files listbox.

   =>     Fixed a bug when clicking the left button in the Take Command
          window while it was displaying output.  Depending on where the
          click was, Take Command could reset its current output point and
          overwrite previous text.

   =>     Fixed a problem with the ? command only displaying the first word
          of the prompt.

   =>     Fixed a problem with long directory paths in the Describe dialog
          box.

   =>     Fixed a minor bug in UNKNOWN_CMD alias processing which caused
          the command processor to remove the command argument if it was
          (1) an existing file, and (2) not an executable file.

   =>     Fixed a problem with the File Find dialog resetting the Disk edit
          control after selecting an item from the Search group.

   =>     Fixed a problem with very long descriptions (over 500
          characters).

   =>     Fixed a problem with piping inside a batch file with arguments
          when a 4START file is loaded.

   =>     Fixed a problem with redirecting to "nul:".




   Take Command 1.01  [10-17-95] UPDAT101.DOC                        page 5


   =>     Fixed a problem with the background color not being redrawn
          properly for the entire window.

   =>     Fixed a minor problem with command line colors when Ctrl-C was
          hit during input.

   =>     Fixed a problem when a DOS application read from STDIN in
          Caveman.

   =>     Fixed a bug which could occasionally cause traps during a DIR, or
          any other command or operation which made a DOS "true name" call.

   =>     DEL:  Disabled "fast deletes" with /Q when /A:... is used to
          specify attributes.  Previously the /Q overrode the /A: and the
          attribute settings were ignored.

   =>     DESCRIBE:  Fixed a problem with clearing a description using the
          syntax:

                  describe file ""

   =>     DO:  Fixed a problem with ITERATE inside nested IFFs inside DOs.

   =>     DRAWBOX:  Fixed a couple of problems with the cursor positioning
          and fill colors when the box was drawn over the current cursor
          position.  Also fixed a problem with the fill color being written
          one column too far to the right.

   =>     FFIND:  Fixed a problem which sometimes caused FFIND to loop
          endlessly printing blank lines; also fixed a problem with FFIND
          not searching past the first 64K of the file in a text search.

   =>     IF:  Now properly supports numeric comparisons when the current
          country uses a whitespace character (e.g., ',') as the decimal
          separator.

   =>     INKEY:  Fixed a problem with combining the /P and /K switches and
          then entering invalid input.

   =>     LIST:  Fixed several problems:  with LIST colors when you have a
          StdColors defined (different from the Windows default) and don't
          have a ListColors defined; with dragging the scrollbar thumbs;
          with scrolling through extremely large files; and with scrolling
          backwards in files with lines longer than 65,520 characters.

   =>     SCRPUT / VSCRPUT:  Now preserve leading quoted whitespace in the
          text argument.

   =>     SELECT:  Fixed a problem when displaying files with very long
          descriptions (over 450 characters).

   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (1.01 rev B)
   ----------------------------------------------------

   =>     Modified the Alias and Environment dialogs to save new entries
          when you switch to another entry (previously you had to hit Enter
          in the value field to save a new entry).

   =>     Partially worked around a Windows bug which may prevent display
          of the last button on the Take Command toolbar when Take Command
          is the Windows shell.

   =>     Added support for expanding variables in the command line in
          program manager items in the Apps menu.  If you have items with
          command lines like %WINSYSDIR%\APPNAME.EXE they should now work
          correctly.

   =>     Filename completion was incorrectly inserting quotes around
          filenames with embedded ampersands.

   =>     Fixed a problem with pasting long lines from the clipboard to the
          command line.

   =>     Fixed problems with long filenames in the TCSTART / TCEXIT path
          and the LOG /W path.

   =>     %_DPMI:  Changed to use the country-dependent decimal character.

   =>     %_WINVER:  Changed to use the country-dependent decimal
          character.

   =>     FFIND:  Fixed a problem with not clearing the hex flag after a
          previous LIST /X.

   =>     LIST:  Fixed a problem with marking lines longer than 511
          characters.

   =>     QUIT:  Fixed a problem with running "QUIT n" from the command
          line.

   =>     SELECT:  Fixed a problem with page numbering in the SELECT
          display.
