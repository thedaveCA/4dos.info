INSTALLATION AND "BRANDING" INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------

   This section explains how to install a downloaded copy of
   Take Command for OS/2.
   
   [If you have a copy on diskette or CD, or a copy purchased
   electronically, we assume you have already completed the installation
   -- otherwise this file would not be visible!  If you need to
   reinstall your purchased copy of Take Command for OS/2, just restart
   the INSTALL program.]

   There are just three steps you need to take to install a downloaded
   copy of Take Command for OS/2:

      >> Extract all the files to a new directory (do not use a directory
         you're using for other products, or for a previous version of
         Take Command for OS/2).

      >> Start Take Command for OS/2.  It will "install itself".

      >> If you are upgrading a previously purchased copy, "brand"
         Take Command for OS/2 with your name and serial number if necessary.

   Additional details on these steps are below.  For branding and manual
   installation instructions see the sections with those headings below.

   You can view any of the documentation files on-line, or copy them to
   your printer.  The Introduction and Installation Guide in TCMDOS2.TXT
   has page breaks, headers and footers; all other documentation files
   are unpaginated ASCII text.


"Self-Installation"

   To begin the installation process, simply run the program file,
   TCMDOS2.EXE, from your desktop.  This will automatically start the
   self-installation file _TCINST.BTM, which will finish installing
   Take Command for OS/2 on your system.

   _TCINST will prompt you for permission before each installation step,
   and no system files will be modified without asking you first.
   
   When the installation is finished, _TCINST renames itself to _TCINST.BTX,
   so that it will not be run again.  (If installation terminates
   abnormally, _TCINST may not be renamed, and will then run again the
   next time you start the program.)


Manual Installation

   For complete manual installation instructions, see the Introduction
   and Installation Guide in the file TCMDOS2.TXT.  The detailed
   instructions for Take Command for OS/2 are in Chapter 7.
   
   If you choose to perform a manual installation you should rename the
   automated installation file, _TCINST.BTM (we recommend renaming it to
   _TCINST.BTX, which is what the file itself does when it's finished).
   If you don't, it will start automatically the first time you run
   Take Command for OS/2.


Branding

   If you are upgrading from a previously purchased copy you may need to
   run the "branding" program to install your name and serial number
   in Take Command for OS/2 (trial version users can skip this section).

   Your previous version's brand program may be the older version named
   BRAND.EXE, or the newer version named BRTCOS2.EXE.

   If you are installing this version as a maintenance release from
   version 2.01, and you branded version 2.01 with the newer
   BRTCOS2.EXE brand program, then in most cases you can skip the
   remainder of this section because your name and serial number will be
   transferred automatically to your new copy of Take Command for OS/2.

   If you are unsure of how the previous version was branded, or if you
   find that the name and serial number are not transferred for any
   reason, follow the instructions below to brand your new version.  You
   will also need the instructions below if you previously used a "file
   brand" following special instructions from our technical support
   department.
   
   In order to perform the branding you will need the brand program, and
   the registered name, serial number, and validation code which came
   with your purchased copy of Take Command for OS/2.

   (If you have lost your branding information it is replaceable, but a
   small charge is required as recreating the codes is a multi-step
   process.  To request replacement codes contact JP Software at
   sales@jpsoft.com, or at one of the addresses listed at the start of
   this file.  (We are currently hoping to make replacement brand codes
   available through the support area of our web site at
   http://www.jpsoft.com/, but we do not yet know when this service will
   be available.)

   The older BRAND.EXE program modifies the TCMDOS2.EXE file, and can only
   be used while Take Command for OS/2 is not running.  To use it:

      (1) Exit from all copies of Take Command for OS/2.

      (2) Start a command prompt session (use another JP Software
      product, or the operating system's built-in command processor).

      (3) Change to the directory where TCMDOS2.EXE is installed, and
      verify that both TCMDOS2.EXE and BRAND.EXE are in that directory.

      (4) Locate the branding information which came with your copy of
      Take Command for OS/2 (information from other products won't work!).

      (5) Enter the command BRAND and follow the instructions on the
      screen.
   
   The newer BRTCOS2.EXE program does not have the same restrictions, and
   can be run using this simpler procedure:

      (1) Start Take Command for OS/2.

      (2) Change to the directory where TCMDOS2.EXE is installed, and
      verify that both TCMDOS2.EXE and BRTCOS2.EXE are in that directory.

      (3) Locate the branding information which came with your copy of
      Take Command for OS/2.

      (4) Enter the command BRTCOS2 and follow the instructions on the
      screen.

   If you attempt to brand your downloaded copy and receive the message
   "brand installation error 4" or "contact JP Software or your dealer
   for an upgrade", then you are not eligible to download and brand a
   trial version of this release -- instead, you must purchase the
   upgrade.  See UPGFORM.TXT for an order form.  Once you have ordered
   an upgrade you can continue to use the trial version until your
   upgrade arrives.

   If you receive any other error, you have probably mistyped your name,
   serial number, or validation code, or are attempting to use the brand
   program or codes from one product with another product, which will
   not work.


NEW VERSION OVERVIEW
--------------------

Since the last major release we've added 150 new features to
Take Command for OS/2!

Here are a very small number of major highlights; for complete details,
see the online help:

   >> Extended Directory Searches allow you to change to a directory
      anywhere on your system by entering only part of its name.  See
      Directory Navigation in the help for complete details.

   >> Take Command for OS/2 is significantly smaller and faster than
      previous versions.

   >> New commands include:

          OPTION:  Offers complete configuration adjustment in all
          products, either through interactive dialogs or on the command
          line.

          SWITCH:  Provides for "case" statements in batch files.

          TOUCH:  Adjusts file dates and times.

          TREE:  Displays the directory tree, with or without file
          names, in a variety of formats.

   >> New file exclusion ranges provide a convenient way to exclude
      files from any internal command -- faster and more flexible than
      using EXCEPT.

   >> The new batch file debugger can execute each line step by step,
      process or trace into additional batch files, and display
      variables, aliases, and expanded commands at each step.

See the online help for 150+ additional new command line tools,
switches, variables, functions and other enhancements!

TECHNICAL SUPPORT
-----------------

   Complete details on technical support are in the Introduction and
   Installation Guide, in the file TCMDOS2.TXT.

   Often the quickest way to reach us for support is electronically.
   Current options are listed below; any additional options offered or
   changes made in the future will be listed on our web site at
   http://www.jpsoft.com/.

   In brief, your support options are:

      >> Internet email to support@jpsoft.com.

      >> JP Software's CompuServe area, accessible via the Quick
         Reference Word "JPSOFT" or directly in section 2 of the
         "CVTHREE" forum.  For support leave a message in this area
         addressed to user ID 75300,1215.

      >> Telephone support on a one business day callback basis (though
         often we return calls much more quickly than that).

         From the US and Canada, the quickest method to reach our
         support staff by phone is to leave a message on our support
         voice message line at 781-646-0798.  Messages are checked
         regularly throughout the day.  Do not use this line for sales,
         customer service, or shipping questions, and please call our

         "telephone tag" with the support staff.

      >> Fax support at 781-646-0904 (however, you will almost always
         receive a faster response to email than to faxed support
         questions).

   When possible, we also read messages posted on the Usenet
   comp.os.msdos.4dos newsgroup.  This newsgroup offers valuable
   information and discussions with other users, but is not managed by
