This file explains how to install the 4DOS 4.01 rev B patch for 4DOS.COM.

To use the patch, you must have the PATCH.EXE program uploaded by JP
Software.  This program is in a separate file, PATCH.ZIP or PATCH4D.ZIP
(depending on your download source).  Instructions for running the PATCH
program are in the file PATCH.DOC which is distributed with PATCH.EXE.

This patch modifies 4DOS.COM only.  To use it, copy the PAT401B.RTP file
to the directory where your 4DOS.COM file for version 4.01 rev A is
stored and enter the command:

      patch . pat401b

The patch update converts your current copy of 4DOS 4.01 rev A to version
4.01 rev B.  Branding (name and serial number) information in your
version 4.01 rev A 4DOS.COM file will be preserved in the modified file.
The modified file will show the same date and time as the original file.
You can check your current version of 4DOS with the VER /R command.  This
command will report "4DOS Revision A" or "4DOS Revision B" in its output.

Version 4.01 rev B fixes the following minor bugs and anomalies in version
4.01 rev A:

   * Descriptions were not always properly deleted when a file was
     deleted.

   * If two copies of 4DOS were started on top of each other in an OS/2
     DOS session (eg START 4DOS from a 4OS2 prompt, which runs one copy
     of 4DOS to start the session and another as the application to run)
     the session would not change the title properly when running an
     external program.

   * 4DOS did not terminate properly when it reached the end of a
     redirected input file (eg 4DOS < cmdlist).
