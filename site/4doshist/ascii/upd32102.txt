   Check through this file for a comprehensive list of what's changed in
   Take Command/32 for Windows NT and Windows 95 since version 1.01. 
   Additional documentation on new features is in the online help. 
   Information about product changes before version 1.01 may be viewed at
   our web page (http://www.jpsoft.com) by selecting Take Command and then
   Product History.  Many product history files are also available in our
   Compuserve forum (GO PCVENB or GO JPSOFT, library 10 / JP Software, look
   for files named UPxxxxxx.ZIP).


   Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
   you aren't using a feature, feel free to skip to the next item.  If you
   are new to Take Command with version 1.01, you can skip this file
   entirely, and begin with the Introduction and Installation Guide.

   This file is divided into the following sections:

          General Features and Enhancements
          Startup and Initialization
          Command Line Editing Changes
          Variables and Variable Functions
          Command Changes
          Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes

   Significant new features and those which affect most users are marked
   with "**" in the lists below.  Other items discuss smaller or more
   technical changes.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the 4DOS LIST
   command, or printed on most PC printers using the command:

              copy updat102.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

                       Take Command/32 1.02 Change List


   General Features and Enhancements
   ---------------------------------

   ==> ** File searches on FAT drives now look for long filenames and then
          short filenames.  For example, suppose you have two files on your
          system:

              Long Name               Short Name
              ------------------      ------------------
              My Letter.DAT           MYLETT~1.DAT
              Files.DAT               MYFILES.DAT

          A search for MY*.DAT will now find both files; previously it
          would find only the first file.  This was done to improve
          compatibility with CMD.EXE and to make the results more
          intuitive.

          CAUTION:  Extra care should be taken performing certain commands
          on long filenames (e.g. using wildcards to delete or move files),
          as they may now affect files with short names as well.  For
          example, DEL *1 will delete all files whose names end in "1". 
          Because short filenames generated by the operating system end in
          "~1", such a command would delete all of those files -- probably
          not the result you wanted.

   ==> ** The print dialog now allows printing a marked block of text, by
          using the "Print Selection" button.  The button will only be
          enabled if text is marked.

   ==>    In the find files dialog, removed the file description / date /
          time text field from under the list box, due to difficulties
          synchronizing updates of this information with list box
          scrolling.  This information is still available by double-
          clicking the file name in this list box.

   ==>    Increased the maximum setting for ConsoleRows to 4096.  

   ==>    Increased the maximum history size from 8K to 32K. 


   Startup and Initialization
   --------------------------

   ==> ** Added a new .INI directive:

              AppendToDir = [Yes | NO]:  If set to "Yes", TCMD will append
              a trailing '\' to directory names when doing filename
              completion.

   Command Line Editing Changes
   ----------------------------

   ==> ** A Ctrl-A on the command line during filename expansion will
          toggle the returned filename between long filename (LFN) and the
          traditional short name (SFN) format.  The default is LFN format;
          if you switch to SFN format the change will only remain in effect
          for the current filename expansion.  Any new expansion sequence
          later on the command line will start in LFN format, and can be
          toggled to SFN format with another Ctrl-A.


   Internal Variables and Variable Functions
   -----------------------------------------

   ==>    @ALTNAME:  Now returns a shortened pathname if you provide it a
          path (and you're running Win95 or NT 3.51+).  If you only give a
          filename, or if you're running NT 3.5, @ALTNAME will return just
          the shortened filename.

   ==>    @EXT:  Increased the maximum length returned to 64 characters.


   Command Changes
   ---------------

   ==>    IF ISWINDOW:  Now supports wildcards in the window name.

   ==> ** LIST:  Enabled mouse button 2 for "copy & paste" operation inside
          LIST.  To use this feature, hold the button down and select an
          area by dragging the cursor.  When you release the button, the
          marked area is copied to the clipboard.  This is the same
          behavior that was already available in the command window.

   ==> ** SHRALIAS:  Rewritten as a mixed internal/external command, rather
          than just an external program.  You must now run the internal
          command, not the external program, and make sure that
          SHRALIAS.EXE is in the Take Command/32 directory or in your path. 
          To convert from the previous version of SHRALIAS, remove the
          extension and path from any SHRALIAS reference, so that the
          internal command is used (you can no longer run the external
          SHRALIAS.EXE directly).  The internal SHRALIAS /U command may be
          used to unload SHRALIAS.EXE.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes
   ---------------------------------------

   ==>    DESCRIPT.ION now allows either a space, tab, or comma as the
          delimiter between the filename and the description.  This is for
          compatibility with some third-party description files.

   ==>    Added a work-around for Windows NT to prevent TCMD/32 from
          crashing after an ENDLOCAL.  

   ==>    Added a check for escaped characters in a redirected filename.

   ==>    Added support for drives over 2GB in DIR, FREE, %@DISKFREE, etc.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with multiple pipes where the first command being
          piped to was an external console-mode application (e.g. DIR |
          SORT | TEE FILE.DAT).

   ==>    Fixed a minor problem with pipes of the form "prog1 | *prog2".

   ==>    Fixed a problem with the Find dialog when double- clicking on a
          filename or selecting the Edit button.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with the Find File dialog not double-quoting
          LFN/HPFS/NTFS names in the "found" listbox.  This problem
          prevented a double click (to retrieve extended information) from
          working on names containing whitespace.

   ==>    Fixed a rare problem when piping from an internal command that
          didn't support command grouping, to an internal or external
          command that ended with a '('.  

   ==>    Fixed a problem with NUL characters in batch files.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with the HistCopy directive.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with files executed via executable extensions. 
          Double quotes are now added if the name contains whitespace.

   ==>    Fixed a problem with marking more than one line using the
          keyboard (e.g. using Shift-Home at the end of a multi-line
          command).

   ==>    Fixed the Find Files dialog so the Disks box correctly reflects
          choices made with the radio buttons.

   ==>    FOR:  Enabled extended parent directory names.

   ==>    Removed the groups/apps from the Win95 Apps menu, as they are
          already included on the Start button, and Take Command could not
          support the nested groups provided by Windows 95 (this may be
          changed in a future revision).

   ==>    Take Command now passes the Pause key on to other applications
          (this should resolve problems found while using SpinWizard).

   ==>    TCMD/32 now creates a new console for executing a .PIF file,
          which keeps Win95 from crashing.

   ==>    The PATH search routine now queries if the specified drive is
          ready before attempting to find an external command, which avoids
          a critical error message.

   ==>    ACTIVATE:  Fixed a problem with the CLOSE option.

   ==>    DDEEXEC:  Added a wait to solve a problem slower systems may have
          with terminating DDE links, fixed a problem which caused a GPF
          when DDEEXEC was invoked with no parameters, and solved a problem
          with DDEEXEC not passing the command arguments.

   ==>    DO:  Now allows embedded equal signs in a test condition.

   ==>    FOR:  Fixed a problem with include lists in the FOR arguments.

   ==>    IF:  Added a work-around for constructs like:

              if 1 == 0 echo foo && echo bar

          to emulate CMD.EXE's behavior of basing the && condition on the
          result of the IF test.

   ==>    INPUT:  Fixed a problem with using INPUT /E in a transient shell. 
          Also solved a problem with INPUT /W /E which prevented the
          existing value from being displayed unless a key was pressed.

   ==>    KEYSTACK:  Fixed a sporadic problem with feeding keystrokes to
          message boxes.

   ==>    LIST:  Fixed problems with:  Using Find with wrap on; marking
          wrapped lines; marking long lines with several embedded tabs; and
          selecting long filenames from the Open dialog.

   ==>    LIST:  Improved LIST's ability to find the end of each line
          properly in files with unusual line terminations (e.g. CR or LF
          alone, LF/CR, CR/CR/LF, etc.).

   ==>    MD:  Fixed a problem with /S and UNC names.
