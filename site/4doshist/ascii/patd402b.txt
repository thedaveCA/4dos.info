This file explains how to install the 4DOS 4.02 rev B patch, which updates
the file 4DOS.COM.

To use the patch, you must have JP Software's PATCH.EXE program.  This
program is in a separate file, PATCH.ZIP (on CompuServe) or 4DPATCH.ZIP
(on bulletin boards and the Internet).

This patch modifies 4DOS.COM only.  To use it, copy the PAT402B.RTP file
to the directory where your 4DOS.COM file for version 4.02 rev A is
stored.  Make sure JP Software's PATCH.EXE is in the same directory, or in
a directory on your PATH, then enter the command:

      patch pat402b

The patch update converts your current copy of 4DOS 4.02 rev A to version
4.02 rev B.  Branding (name and serial number) information in your
4DOS.COM file will be preserved in the modified file.  The modified file
will show a new date and time.  You can check your current version of 4DOS
with the VER /R command.  This command will report "4DOS Revision A" or
"4DOS Revision B" in its output.

Version 4.02 rev B fixes the following minor bugs and anomalies in version
4.02 rev A:

    * 4DOS was not properly recognizing the March 1993 DR-DOS 6.0 update
      as DR-DOS, and therefore LOADHIGH did not work properly.

    * Long directory names, where the directory name was under 63
      characters but the directory name plus file name was not, were
      not always handled properly.

    * 4DOS was not handling the (incorrect) null PATH created by
      COMMAND.COM primary shells under unusual circumstances in some DOS
      versions.

    * The installable command API described in Appendix C of the manual did
      not work properly.

    * Color commands would not work correctly if bright background and
      blinking were both specified.
