This patch updates 4OS2 as follows:

     Original:      Version 2.51 rev A
     Updated to:    Version 2.51 rev B
     Release date:  10-17-95

This file explains how to install the patch.  To use this patch, you
must have:

     * JP Software's PATCH.EXE program.  PATCH.EXE is distributed in a
       separate file, 4DPATCH.ZIP, and is available on our CompuServe,
       BBS, and Internet sites.  You should be able to find it where you
       found this file.  (* Also see note below regarding other versions
       of PATCH.EXE.)

     * A copy of 4OS2 2.51 rev A.  The simplest way to check
       your revision level is to use the VER /R command.

To use this patch, copy the 4OS2251B.RTP file to the directory where
your 4OS2 version 2.51 files are stored.  Make sure JP
Software's PATCH.EXE is in the same directory, or in a directory on your
PATH, then enter the command:

      patch 4OS2251B

This patch modifies the following files:

          4OS2.EXE
          4OS2-16.EXE
          4OS2DLL.DLL
          4OS2.DOC
          4OS2.INF
          UPDAT251.DOC
          ORDER.FRM
          ORDERINF.DOC

Any branding (name and serial number) information will be preserved
in the modified files.  If any of the files are missing the patch
program will continue without patching them.

If you want to test 4OS2 to make sure the patch worked, restart the
program and then use the VER /R command.

If you are short on disk space and receive a message that there is not
enough space to perform the patch, you can use a command like this to
reduce the disk space required:

      patch /noundo 4OS2251B

This will make recovery slightly more difficult in the unlikely event of
a power failure or similar problem during the patch process, but will
reduce the disk space required to perform the patch.


For a list of changes in this revision see the file UPDAT251.DOC after
the patch is completed.  Any substantial changes in this revision are
included in the body of the file, with the revision letter included to
the left of the relevant paragraphs (e.g.  ==>B for a change made in
revision B).  Minor changes and bug fixes are listed in chronological
order at the end of the UPDAT251.DOC file.  If you do not have a copy
of UPDAT251.DOC in your original directory, the patch program cannot
update it and you will not be able to view these lists.


(* JP Software's PATCH.EXE is the version 1.10 patch program from the
.RTPatch patch software sold by PocketSoft Inc.  If you have a copy of
PATCH.EXE version 1.10 or later from another company which also uses
.RTPatch to update its software, you can use it with JP Software
patches. However, we recommend that you do NOT use version 2.0 of
PATCH.EXE under OS/2.  When PATCH.EXE 2.0 is used under OS/2 it patches
the files properly, but does not correctly update the dates and times of
the patched files.)
