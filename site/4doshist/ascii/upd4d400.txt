                           Version 4.0 -- November 18, 1991

        Copyright 1988 - 1991, JP Software Inc., All Rights Reserved.  Pub-

        Version 4.0 is a major new release and many parts of 4DOS have
        changed.  The list below summarizes these changes for version 3.0
        through 3.03 users; users who are new to 4DOS with version 4.0 can
        skip this information.

        This file is a summary list only, it doesn't explain how to use new
        features and enhancements.  For more details on items which are relat-
        ed to a specific command, see that command's entry in the command
        reference section of the manual.  For other items, look up the subject
        the item discusses in the manuals's table of contents or index to find
        more information.

        Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
        you aren't using the feature described, feel free to skip through to
        the next item!

        Items in this file marked with "**" are changes that occurred after
        the manual went to press.  These items are more fully documented in
        the MANMOD.DOC file distributed with registered copies of 4DOS and in
        the ASCII (on-disk) manual, but are not documented in the printed
        manual.


        Installation and Configuration
        ------------------------------

           4DOS is now a single file, 4DOS.COM.  The old structure of separate
           4DOS.COM and 4DOS88.EXE / 4DOS286.EXE files has been eliminated.

           There is a wide variety of new startup options for 4DOS, ranging
           from the simple to the highly technical.  Most of the startup
           switches that used to go on the SHELL= line in CONFIG.SYS or in the
           4DSHELL environment variable have been eliminated, and 4DOS config-
           uration is now controlled through the new 4DOS.INI file, for both
           primary and secondary shells.  Those switches which still work for
           DOS compatibility reasons (such as /E: for environment size) can
           also be set through 4DOS.INI.

           If you install 4DOS manually or have a complex configuration, you
           should read about 4DOS.INI in the manual before modifying your
           SHELL= line to load version 4.0!  See Chapter 6 for more details.

           The following summary lists version 3 startup switches and the
           corresponding 4DOS.INI directive for version 4.0.  Switches marked
           with a "*" are still available in version 4.0, in order to maintain
           compatibility with DOS.

           The KEYSTACK.SYS device driver is no longer used.  It has been
           replaced by KSTACK.COM, a TSR (memory-resident program), normally
           loaded from AUTOEXEC.BAT (or with INSTALL= in CONFIG.SYS).

           The /P switch is now set automatically when 4DOS is loaded as the
           true primary shell via a SHELL= statement in CONFIG.SYS.

           4DOS now supports the COMMAND.COM syntax for specifying a COMSPEC
           directory in the SHELL statement.  See "Setting up CONFIG.SYS". 
           However (see next item) ...

           Under MS-DOS and PC-DOS you probably won't need to set the COMSPEC
           directory on the SHELL= line or in AUTOEXEC.  4DOS sets it automat-
           ically in most cases, provided that you specify the full path for
           4DOS.COM in the name you use on the SHELL= line in CONFIG.SYS.  If
           you use DR-DOS automatic determination of the COMSPEC directory
           will NOT work, so you will have to set the directory yourself on
           the SHELL= line.  (Thanks to Hans Salvisberg, author of BOOT.SYS,
           for the technical information needed to implement the automatic
           COMSPEC directory feature!).  See "Setting up CONFIG.SYS".

           4DOS can now load its resident portion and / or the master environ-
           ment into DOS 5 UMBs.  DOS 5 UMBs are used automatically if they
           are available and if UMB access is requested with the UMBLoad or
           UMBEnvironment directive in 4DOS.INI.

           Swapping is now controlled by the Swapping directive in 4DOS.INI. 
           You can use this directive to set up any sequence of swapping at-
           tempts you like (for example, you can tell 4DOS to try EMS, then
           your RAM disk, then XMS, then the hard disk).  If no Swapping di-
           rective is used the default is to try EMS, then XMS, then the root
           directory of the boot drive if it is drive C: or higher.  4DOS will




        4DOS 4.0  [11-18-91]         UPDATE40.DOC                       page 2


           no longer attempt to swap to drive A: or B: by default (though you
           can tell it to if you want to).  If all of these methods fail, 4DOS
           will load resident.

           Most SETDOS settings can be initialized in the 4DOS.INI file. 
           SETDOS settings are now inherited automatically in secondary
           shells, so you no longer need to put a SETDOS command into the
           4START file to get the right settings in secondary shells.

           The LOG state and log file name are now inherited by secondary
           shells, and may be set at boot time using the LogName directive in
           4DOS.INI.

           For BBS operators, the /F startup switch (or the CritFail directive
           in 4DOS.INI) generates an automatic "fail" response to all critical
           errors.


        General Features
        ----------------

           The PATH search is now faster by 50 - 100% depending on where the
           file is found in the path.

           Secondary shells now require only about 1.7K of resident space
           (down from about 2.8K in version 3.03).  The primary shell require-
           ment is still 3K or less under most circumstances.

           Description file processing has been sped up substantially, and
           should generate much less network traffic than before.

           Directory displays in DIR and SELECT can now be colorized based on
           file extension or attributes.  See "COLORDIR".

           "Include lists" which allow you to specify multiple files with a
           single path were only available for the DIR and SELECT commands in
           4DOS 3.03.  In version 4.0 they have been extended to all 4DOS file
           processing commands, and the separator character has been changed
           to a semicolon.  For example, the command:

                 copy d:\data\*.dat;*.txt a:

           will copy the .DAT and .TXT files from D:\DATA to drive A:.  See
           "Include Lists".

           Wildcards have been enhanced so that you can specify lists or rang-
           es of characters to include or exclude.  For example [abf-h]*.*
           means all files whose names begin with a, b, f, g, or h.  See
           "Wildcards".






        4DOS 4.0  [11-18-91]         UPDATE40.DOC                       page 3


           4DOS now performs variable expansion on the prompt string, so any
           environment variable, internal variable, or variable function can
           be put into the prompt and displayed.

           When 4DOS exits from a shell it looks for and executes a 4EXIT.BAT
           or 4EXIT.BTM file (like the 4START file).  This can be used to save
           history or perform other actions.

           All upper case conversions (SETDOS /C1, DIR /C, @UPPER, etc.) now
           support international characters.

           Executable extensions will now support internal commands, and they
           no longer require the full path name of an executable file.  Also,
           executable extensions now support wildcards, including the new
           extended wildcards.  For example, to set the program for all exten-
           sions starting with WK to 123:

                 set .wk?=d:\123\123.com

           A "." can now be used in the PATH to delay the search of the cur-
           rent directory.

           Command grouping (originally an OS/2 feature) has been added to
           4DOS.  This allows you to use parentheses to group commands logi-
           cally.  This is a powerful feature, especially when used with the
           "prefix" commands like EXCEPT, FOR, GLOBAL, and SELECT.

           4DOS now supports Microsoft's command processor based message pro-
           cessing scheme for DOS external commands.  If you enter a DOS ex-
           ternal command with a bad argument (eg DEBUG XYZZY) in DOS 4 or
           above you will now get a real error message (eg "File not found")
           instead of a numerical message ("Extended error 2").  This feature
           adds about 200 bytes to the resident size of 4DOS, and can be dis-
           abled with the "MessageServer = No" directive in 4DOS.INI.


        At the Command Line
        -------------------

           The command history can now be viewed and executed from a popup
           window as well as at the command line.

           "Automatic directory changes" let you change to a directory by
           typing its name followed by a backslash.


        4DOS HELP System
        ----------------

           The help system has been extensively revised.  It now supports line
           by line scrolling, and scrolling and paging with the mouse follow




        4DOS 4.0  [11-18-91]         UPDATE40.DOC                       page 4


           industry standard conventions.  The mouse can be used more easily
           to perform most help navigation functions.

           The help text has been updated and expanded to cover all new 4DOS
           features as well as MS-DOS 5 external commands.

           Help is now context sensitive.  If you press F1 from the command
           line, 4DOS will try to find help for the first command on the line. 
           If there is no help for that command, you will be put into the main
           HELP menu.

           The help program has been renamed 4HELP.EXE to avoid conflicts with
           other HELP.EXE programs.  This program is run when F1 is pressed at
           the command line or when the HELP command is executed.  The help
           text file is now 4DOS.HLP (for those with a utility disk, the ASCII
           text file is 4DOS.TXT).  The 4HELP, 4HELPF, and 4HELPC environment
           variables have been removed and replaced by the 4DOS.INI directives
           HelpPath and HelpOptions.

           The new HELP system is not compatible with the version 3.0 HELP
           system; if you have modified the version 3.0 HELP text you must
           purchase a version 4.0 Utility Disk and recompile your help text to
           use it with 4DOS 4.0 HELP.

           HELPCFG now supports a /M switch to force it to run in monochrome
           mode and adjust the monochrome HELP colors, even on color systems. 
           Also the HELPCFG exit keys have been changed to conform to general
           usage standards.


        I/O Redirection
        ---------------

           Added a new environment variable for directing where to create the
           temporary pipe files in 4DOS.  4DOS will first look for the envi-
           ronment variable TEMP4DOS; if it doesn't find it it will look for
           the (DOS 5 standard) TEMP variable; if it doesn't find that pipes
           will be created in the root directory of the boot disk.

           Pipe names are now unique for each shell, to avoid conflicts when
           running pipes in different partitions under a multitasker.


        Environment Variables, Internal Variables, and Variable Functions
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        There are many new environment variables, internal variables, and
        variable functions -- far too many to list here!  This section just
        mentions a few highlights; see the manual for full details.

           New environment variables used by 4DOS include CDPATH, COLORDIR,
           and TEMP4DOS.  The old TMP has been changed to TEMP for DOS 5 com-



        4DOS 4.0  [11-18-91]         UPDATE40.DOC                       page 5


           patibility.  The old 4DSHELL variable has been eliminated, its
           functions are now provided by 4DOS.INI.  One new variable (_CDPATH,
           as opposed to CDPATH) is described in MANMOD.DOC, but is not in the
           printed manual.

           New internal variables let you access a broad range of information
           on system status and configuration.  Some didn't make it into the
           manual:  see the beginning of this file for information on _BOOT,
           _LASTDISK, _MOUSE, and _TRANSIENT.

           In addition a very large number of variable functions have been
           added providing a wide array of new functions -- everything from
           available memory and disk space to menuing.  A few of these func-
           tions didn't make it into the printed manual, so see the ASCII
           manual or MANMOD.DOC for information on @ALIAS, @DEVICE, @LINES,
           @MAKEDATE, @MAKETIME, @READSCR, and @SELECT, and some changes to
           @LINE, @SUBSTR, and @WORD.

           Environment variable expansion will now handle nested variables in
           the form %[%var] (or even %[%[%var]]!).

           There are some enhancements to specific variables and functions:

              _DATE and _TIME:  Return a leading zero if the first number in
              the date or time string is less than 10.

              @EVAL:  Now supports decimal places!  Numbers can have up to 16
              digits to the left of the decimal point and 8 to the right. 
              Also %@EVAL now accepts commas in numbers.

              @LINE:  Now returns "**EOF**" at the end of the file.  Also
              @LINE can now get its input from STDIN if you specify "con" as
              the filename**.

              @SUBSTR:  The last argument (the length of the string) is now
              optional; it will default to the remainder of the string**.

              @WORD:  Now allows you to return words from the end of the
              string**.  For example %@word[-0,now is the time] returns
              "time", %@word[-2,now is the time] returns "is".


        Aliases
        -------

           The command line can now grow to up to 512 bytes while an alias is
           being executed.  The alias definition itself is still limited to
           255 bytes.

           "Key aliases" allow you to assign aliases to function keys and most
           Alt and Ctrl keys.  See "Keystroke aliases".




        4DOS 4.0  [11-18-91]         UPDATE40.DOC                       page 6


           QUIT can now be used in aliases.


        Batch Files
        -----------

           GOSUB now saves the IFF state, so you can use IFF within subrou-
           tines without interfering with an IFF in the calling section of the
           batch file.

           .BAT files have been sped up significantly, especially when execut-
           ing internal commands (this speed increase applies only to .BAT
           files, not to .BTM files which are already much faster).


        Command Changes
        ---------------

        This section describes changes to 4DOS commands and new commands, but
        only briefly.  It is intended to alert you to areas where your use of
        4DOS commands may need to be changed, not to provide a comprehensive
        description.  See the manual for full details.

           ATTRIB:  Added two new switches:  /Q (quiet) and /S (process cur-
           rent directory and its subdirectories).

           CANCEL:  Now accepts an optional argument to set the ERRORLEVEL.

           CD and CDD:  These commands now use the CDPATH environment variable
           to find the subdirectory to change to.  This allows changing to a
           subdirectory without typing its full path name.  Also, CD and CDD
           now save the previous directory, and allow you to switch back to it
           with "CD -" or "CDD -".

           CLS and COLOR:  Can now set the screen border color, and will set
           colors with or without ANSI loaded.  If ANSI is not loaded, the
           colors will not be "sticky" -- you may lose them when you run an
           application.

           COPY:  New switches include /C (copy changed files only), /H (copy
           hidden files), /N (do nothing, just test results of copy), and /S
           (copy files from the current directory and its subdirectories).  /Q
           (quiet) now turns off the display of the number of files copied. 
           If you copy a file and the target file has a description but the
           source doesn't, 4DOS will now preserve the target description; this
           allows you to update files without losing the descriptions.  A full
           destination disk during a COPY will now give an informative mes-
           sage, and stop the copy.  COPY now preserves Hidden and System
           attributes (but not Read Only) when creating the target file.

           DEL:  New switches include /N (do nothing, just test results of
           DEL), /S (delete files from the current directory and its subdirec-



        4DOS 4.0  [11-18-91]         UPDATE40.DOC                       page 7


           tories), /X (remove empty subdirectories), and /Z (allow deletion
           of hidden, system, and read-only files).  If you have a large num-
           ber of files to delete you can increase deletion speed dramatically
           if you use the /Q switch and do NOT use 4DOS's extended wildcards
           in the file name.

           DIR:  (See additional section below on switch changes).  Directory
           displays can now be colorized with COLORDIR.  Free space displays
           will be correct even on JOINed, SUBSTed, or ASSIGNed drives in DOS
           3.1 and above.  File description handling has been sped up signifi-
           cantly.  Directory names are displayed in square brackets [] for
           DOS 5 compatibility.  If an argument begins with "\\", 4DOS will
           assume it's a network reference and will not try to get the volume
           label or disk space for that drive, to avoid network errors.

           DIR Switches:  Many switches have been changed for DOS 5 compati-
           bility; a summary is below.  DIR now supports the DOS 5 sort order
           switches (/O:[-degns]), as well as the original 4DOS switches
           (/O:[-eirtuz]).  The new /O:a option sorts the directory in stan-
           dard ASCII order rather than sorting filenames containing numbers
           in the default numerical order.  A byproduct of the switch changes
           is that the /A:xxxx and /O:xxxx switches CANNOT be followed by
           another parameter without an intervening slash.  For example, you
           used to be able to say DIR /OEP to display the directory in exten-

           DRAWBOX:  Added a new "shadow" option to create a transparent drop
           shadow for the box.

           ECHOS:  This is a new command which works just like an ECHO, but
           doesn't print a CR/LF at the end of a line.  It's useful when redi-
           recting output to a printer or other device.

           ESET:  The new /M switch makes the change to the master environ-
           ment, not the local one.

           EXIT can now accept and return a result code (error level) to the
           program that started a secondary shell.

           FOR:  The set to be processed can now be read from a file.  The new
           /A: switch allows selection of files for processing based on at-
           tributes, using the same syntax as DIR /A**.

           GLOBAL:  Added switches /H (process hidden directories) and /P
           (prompt before executing the command in each directory)**.

           GOTO:  Added a /I switch which tells 4DOS to NOT cancel IFF pro-
           cessing.  (Use only if you know EXACTLY what you're doing, and
           don't attempt to jump outside of the IFF or into a different IFF or
           IFF nesting level!)

           HISTORY:  Two switches were added:  /A adds a command to the histo-
           ry list; /P pauses after displaying each page of the history.

           IF and IFF:  Most of the old tests for system resources (EMS, XMS,
           DISKFREE, etc.) have been moved to variable functions to make the
           information available throughout 4DOS rather than just in IF and
           IFF.  You will need to edit your batch files or aliases if you used
           these tests in IF or IFF commands (see below).  New conditional
           operators .AND., .OR., and .XOR. have been added.  Some new tests
           have been added:  ISINTERNAL tests if a string matches the name of
           an internal command; ISLABEL tests if a label exists in the current
           batch file**.

           KEYSTACK:  Key names can be entered mnemonically, and delays can
           now be included in the keystroke sequence.  The KEYSTACK.SYS device
           driver has been removed and replaced by a TSR, KSTACK.COM.

           LH:  New command added to support DOS 5's load high capability.

           LIST:  Now saves your position on a search or a print, and returns
           you to it after the print or an unsuccessful search.  You can now
           toggle the high bit (/H) and line wrap (/W) flags from inside LIST,
           and /W(rap) now affects the P(rint) option.

           LOADHIGH:  New command added to support DOS 5's load high capabili-
           ty.

           LOG:  The LOG state and file name are now inherited by secondary
           shells.  The log file name and/or path can be set with the LogName
           directive in 4DOS.INI** (using LogName does not turn logging on,
           you must still use LOG ON to do so).

           MOVE:  New switches include /C (move changed files only), /D (re-
           quire that the destination be a directory), /H (move hidden files),
           /N (do nothing, just test results of move), and /S (move files from
           the current directory and its subdirectories).  /Q (quiet) now
           turns off the display of the number of files copied.  If you move a
           file and the target file has a description but the source doesn't,
           4DOS will now preserve the target description; this allows you to
           update files without losing the descriptions.  A full destination
           disk during a MOVE will now give an informative message, and stop
           the move.

           PROMPT:  Environment variables, internal variables, and variable
           functions can now be used from within the prompt, allowing you to
           include a wide variety of values in your prompt text.  The case of
           the path displayed in the prompt is now controlled solely by the $P
           and $p characters, and is not affected by SETDOS /U.

           QUIT:  Now accepts an optional argument to set the ERRORLEVEL.

           REBOOT:  This is a new command which does a warm or cold boot, with
           an optional verification prompt.  You need to test it on your sys-
           tem as some reboot methods do not work on all systems or with all
           other software.

           REN has two new switches:  /N (do nothing, just test results of
           rename); /S (allow subdirectory renames).  Subdirectory renames are
           now disabled if wildcards are used in the old name, to avoid inad-
           vertent renaming of directories; you can enable them with /S.

           SELECT:  There are some new switches and switch changes:  /A se-
           lects files based on attribute (see DIR), /C displays in upper
           case, /D disables directory colorization**, and /O has the same
           changes as in DIR.  A "*" now reverses the marks on all files,

           rather than simply marking all files -- for example, if you mark 3
           files and then press '*' SELECT will unmark those three files and
           mark all the others.  You can now unmark all of the marked files
           with a '/'.

           SET:  The new /M switch makes the change to the master environment,
           not the local one.  The syntax has been changed to match
           COMMAND.COM:  you MUST enter an '=' in a SET statement, and you may
           now put whitespace in the variable name or the argument.  Also, if
           you enter SET VARNAME with nothing else on the line SET will now
           display the value of the variable, rather than removing it from the
           environment as it used to.  To remove an environment variable, you
           must add the "=" sign to the end (e.g. SET VARNAME=), or use UNSET. 
           Also note that, because whitespace in environment variable names
           and values is now preserved, batch files with lines like
           "SET MYVAR = MYVALUE" may not work unless they are changed to elim-
           inate the extra spaces.  Under 4DOS 3.03 this example would set
           "MYVAR" to "MYVALUE; under 4DOS 4.0 it will set "MYVAR " to
           " MYVALUE".

           SETDOS:  The /A option can now be set to tell 4DOS that ANSI is not
           loaded (/A2).  The /H option has been removed; the minimum length
           of a command to save can be set with the HistMin option in
           4DOS.INI.  The /S option now uses percentages, not line counts, to
           set the cursor shape for insert and overstrike modes.  The /U op-
           tion no longer affects the case of the path displayed in the 4DOS
           prompt; that is now controlled solely by the $P and $p PROMPT char-
           acters.  The /V option can now be set to echo everything, even if
           echo is off (/V2)**.

           SWAPPING:  Now displays the current swapping type (EMS, XMS, Disk,
           or None) as well as the swapping state.

           TIMER:  There are now three timers available, selected with /1, /2,
           or /3.  TIMER ON can be used to force a reset of the timer regard-
           less of the current state.

           TRUENAME:  This is a new command which displays the true name of a
           file, even on ASSIGNed, JOINed, or SUBSTed drives.

           UNSET:  The new /M switch makes the change to the master environ-
           ment, not the local one.

           VER:  The new /R switch displays the DOS revision level and loca-
           tion of the DOS kernel (DOS 5 only)**.

           VSCRPUT:  This is a new command which has the same parameters as
           SCRPUT, but displays the string vertically.

        Technical Changes
        -----------------

        These changes are primarily of interest to programmers and others
        interested in "how 4DOS works".  Most users do not need to read this
        information.

           New programming interfaces are included in version 4.0; see Appen-
           dix C of the manual for details.  These include a new KEYSTACK
           interface, installable commands, and extended information in the
           DESCRIPT.ION file.

           Full support for INT 2E is now provided.  See the "Appendix C"
           section of this file for details.

           4DOS now reserves all available DOS RAM while it is running at the
           prompt.  This space is freed as needed for BTM files, DIR, LIST,
           SELECT, etc., and is always freed when starting an application. 
           This mimics COMMAND.COM; we have implemented it to get around some
           odd behavior with loading certain networks or TSRs which depend on
           this approach.

           4DOS now detects a version mismatch with a previous shell and dis-
           ables alias and history inheritance and reduced swapping if one is
           found.

           4DOS now supports third-party INT 24 (critical error) handlers like
           4DOS24H, and will no longer disable them when an unruly TSR
           unloads.

           The 4DOS transient portion is now 100% dynamically relocatable. 
           This means if you have a TSR that grabs a block from the end of DOS
           memory, 4DOS will dynamically relocate itself below the TSR when it
           swaps in after the TSR goes resident.  The only thing you can't do
           is load such a TSR with swapping off, then turn swapping back on. 
           If you do the results will not be good.

           Reduced swapping is now enabled all the time.  Starting a secondary
           shell under DESQView, or when alias or environment space is expand-
           ed, etc., will no longer result in a full-sized swap area.  The
           only way to get a full-sized swap area in a secondary shell is to
           force it with the Reduce = NO directive in 4DOS.INI, or to load one
           version of 4DOS on top of another.

           The maximum internal line size in 4DOS has been increased from 255
           to 512 characters.  The maximum command line length is still 255,
           but the increase in the internal buffer will allow you to have more
           complex aliases, variables, and command groups.

        COMPATIBILITY CHANGES
        ---------------------

        This section gives a quick overview of changes to 4DOS 4.0 to enhance
        compatibility with other software.  For details on any specific pack-
        age see APPNOTES.DOC.

           ANSI:  4DOS has improved ANSI detection and now will usually cor-
           rectly detect whether ANSI is loaded regardless of whether ANSI or
           DOS is loaded high or low.  If you have problems with ANSI detec-
           tion use SETDOS /A or the ANSI directive in 4DOS.INI to tell 4DOS
           whether ANSI is installed.

           APPEND:  4DOS sets APPEND's /PATH:OFF flag if using DOS 4 or DOS 5. 
           This will eliminate any attempt by APPEND to extend its searches in
           a way that interferes with 4DOS file access and file descriptions.

           DESQview:  A Close Window command from within 4DOS will now release
           all resources (XMS, EMS, UMB, swap file, shell number, interrupts)
           owned by 4DOS before the window is closed, just as if you typed
           EXIT.  4DOS only performs this cleanup if you are actually in 4DOS
           when you issue the Close Window command.  If you are in an applica-
           tion the cleanup will not occur.

           DR-DOS:  Several changes have been made for DR-DOS compatibility
           including access to 4DOS extended wildcards, and use of DR-DOS
           passwords (the ";" must be doubled on certain commands for this to
           work).

           Novell Netware:  Numerous changes have been made to improve Netware
           compatibility, especially with 4DOS redirection and batch files. 
           Novell has also fixed bugs which would cause environment variables
           to be destroyed when logging in to the network under 4DOS.  Also,
           you can now swap secondary shells to a network drive using the
           SwapReopen dircetive in 4DOS.INI.

           Windows:  4DOS now detects Windows 3 and configures itself accord-
           ingly.  At startup you will get a message:  "4DOS running under
           Windows 3 in [Win3 mode]".  There will be no message if you aren't
           running under Win3.  Memory allocation in Win3 is now automatic,
           hence there is no need for the old /V switch.
