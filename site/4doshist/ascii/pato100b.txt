This file explains how to install the 4OS2 1.0 rev B patch for 4OS2.EXE.

To use the patch, you must have the PATCH.EXE program uploaded by JP
Software.  This program is in a separate file, PATCH.ZIP or PATCH4D.ZIP
(depending on your download source).  Instructions for running the PATCH
program are in the file PATCH.DOC which is distributed with PATCH.EXE.  

This patch modifies 4OS2.EXE only.  To use it, copy the PAT10B.RTP file
to the directory where your 4OS2.EXE file for version 1.0 rev A is
stored.  Then exit from all sessions running 4OS2, start a DOS session,
change to the 4OS2.EXE directory, and enter the command:

      patch . pat10B

(PATCH.EXE is a "bound application" and will run in an OS/2 session, but
OS/2 will not allow you to modify 4OS2.EXE while it is in use; this is
why we recommend performing the patch in a DOS session.)

The patch update converts your current copy of 4OS2 1.0 rev A to version
1.0 rev B.  The modified file will show the same date and time as the
original file.  You can check your current version of 4OS2 with the VER
/R command. This command will report "4OS2 Revision A" or "4OS2 Revision
B" in its output.

Version 1.0 rev B fixes the following minor bugs and anomalies in version
1.0 rev A:

   * Descriptions were not always properly deleted when a file was
     deleted.

   * 4OS2 did not terminate properly when it reached the end of a
     redirected input file (eg 4OS2 < cmdlist).

   * DOS sessions did not always start properly when using START /DOS
     with COMMAND.COM (rather than 4DOS) as the DOS command processor.

   * If 4OS2 was passed a quoted string on the startup command line, it
     trapped (SYS3175 error).  This would happen if you added 4OS2 to
     the Workplace Shell System Menu and OS/2 was booted from an HPFS
     drive.
