                 Patch Documentation -- April 12, 1999

This patch updates:

   From:   4DOS v6.02 rev A (build 128)
   To:     4DOS v6.02 rev B (build 130)

This file explains how to install the patch.

To use this patch, you must have:

     * JP Software's PATCH.EXE program.  PATCH.EXE is distributed in a
       separate file, JPPATCH.ZIP, and is available on our Internet FTP
       site and in our CompuServe file area (see below for details).

     * A copy of 4DOS 6.02 rev A (build 128).

       The simplest way to check your revision and build number is to
       use use the VER /R command.

To use this patch, copy the 4DOS130.RTP file to the directory where
your 4DOS version 6.02 (128) files are stored.

Make sure JP Software's PATCH.EXE is in the same directory, or in a
directory on your PATH, then enter the command:

      patch 4DOS130

This patch modifies the following files:

          4DOS.COM
          4DOS.HLP
          OPTION.EXE

Any branding (name and serial number) information will be preserved in
the modified files.  If any of the files are missing the patch program
will continue without patching them.

If you want to test 4DOS to make sure the patch worked, restart the
program and then use the VER /R command.  After the patch is complete
VER /R should report version 6.02B (130).


The changes in this revision / build include:

   Bugs Fixed
   ----------

     * INKEY and INPUT:  Fixed a problem with /W which would hang these
       commands until the wait time ended.  [TC32 only, did not affect
       other products]

     * @EXEC:  Fixed a problem which prevented the command from being
       executed at all if it was preceded with an @.

     * @MAKEAGE:  Fixed a problem which caused 2-digit dates to be
       interpreted based on 1980 rather than 2000 (e.g.  01-01-02 was
       taken to mean 1-Jan-1982 rather than the correct value,
       1-Jan-2000).

     * Fixed a problem which occasionally caused spurious "internal
       error" crashes.

If this patch updates the help file (see the file list above) you can
also review this change list in the "What's New" section of the online
help, under "Bugs Fixed", after the patch is completed.
