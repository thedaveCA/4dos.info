   Check through this file for a comprehensive list of what's changed since
   version 5.5.  Additional documentation on new features is in the online
   help.

   Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
   you aren't using a feature, feel free to skip to the next item.  If you
   are new to 4DOS with version 5.51, you can skip this file entirely, and
   begin with the 4DOS Introduction and Installation Guide.

   This file is divided into the following sections:

          General Features and Enhancements
          Startup and Initialization
          Command Changes
          Internal Variables and Variable Functions
          Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (each revision)

   Significant new features and those which affect most users are marked
   with "**" in the lists below.  Other items discuss smaller or more
   technical changes.

   This file may cover multiple revisions (e.g. version 5.51A, 5.51B,
   etc.).  Most items refer to changes made in the initial release,
   revision A.  Any item with a revision letter in the left margin (e.g. an
   item marked with "=>B") was added or updated in that revision.  Minor
   technical, compatibility, and bug fixes for each revision are listed at
   the end of the file.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the 4DOS LIST
   command, or printed on most PC printers using the command:

                  copy updat551.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

                             4DOS 5.51 Change List

   General Features and Enhancements
   ---------------------------------

   =>B ** 4DOS now supports beta versions of Windows 95 including long
          filenames, LOCK and UNLOCK commands, and several other features. 
          See the "Win95" topic in the online help for additional
          information if you are using 4DOS under Windows 95.

   => **  4DOS now supports PC-DOS 7 REXX batch files.  Any .BAT file with
          "/*" at the beginning of the first line will be passed to
          REXX.EXE for processing, just as it is under PC-DOS 7
          COMMAND.COM.

   =>     4DOS now supports batch file line continuation.  Lines terminated
          with an escape character (Ctrl-X) will have the escape character
          removed and the next line appended.


   Startup and Initialization
   --------------------------

   =>     4DOS will not inherit aliases, .INI settings, etc. from a primary
          shell under Windows 95 if disk swapping is used in the primary
          shell.  This is because the file handle for the primary shell's
          swap file cannot be passed properly to a secondary shell under
          Windows 95.  Also a message is now displayed when 4DOS starts as
          a secondary shell under Windows 95 (as it did previously for Win
          3.x).

   =>     Added two new .INI directives:

              ListExit = Key (Esc):  Allows you to map the keystroke used
              to exit the LIST command.

              RexxPath = Path:  If RexxPath is set, 4DOS will look at .BAT
              files to see if they're REXX files (begin with a /*); if they
              are 4DOS will insert the program name specified in RexxPath
              in front of the batch file name and reexecute it.  If you're
              running PC-DOS 7, 4DOS will default to using "REXX.EXE" for
              the RexxPath directive.


   Command Changes
   ---------------

   => **  COPY / DEL / MOVE / REN:  When using the prompt (/P) option, an
          ESCAPE will now cancel further processing for that argument,
          rather than canceling prompting and continuing with the
          operation.

   => **  DIR:  Added the /Z switch to force the old ("8.3"-style) filename
          display on drives which support long filenames, and the /X switch
          to display both the long and short filenames (under Windows 95
          only).

   =>B ** DIR / SELECT:  Colorizing filenames with no extension wasn't
          specifically covered before, though you could do it by using
          "*:color" to color everything.  You can now specify files without
          extensions using the syntax " :color".  For example, the
          following ColorDir setting in the .INI file will color EXE files
          red, TXT files bright red, and files with no extension bright
          cyan:

                  ColorDir = exe:red;txt:bri red; :bri cya

   =>     GOSUB / GOTO:  Made a change to try to accommodate both the old
          label style (first word only) and the new style that permits
          multi-word labels.

   =>     IFF:  Changed the way the command processor handles piping to
          IFF.  You can now pipe to an IFF and the pipe information will be
          passed to the command(s) following the IFF (previously it was
          ignored).

   =>B    LIST:  Now defaults to listing (all files ("*.*") if the argument
          is a directory name.  Also printing the file now displays a
          header (filename, date, and time) on the first page, and GOTO now
          supports negative offsets -- for example you can enter "-10" to
          go back 10 lines.  When using negative offsets, the number of
          lines moved will not correspond accurately to the line count in
          the LIST status bar when the LIST display is wrapped.

   =>     LOCK, UNLOCK:  Added these new Win95 commands.  See the online
          help for syntax and other details.

   =>     ON:  Added a new ON ERRORMSG option.  ON ERRORMSG is the same as
          ON ERROR, but displays the usual error message before executing
          the specified command (ON ERROR suppresses the error message).

   =>     SETDOS:  You can now change the default description filename with
          the SETDOS /D switch.  If the /D is followed by a double quote,
          the string inside the quotes will be used as the description
          file.  For example:

                  setdos /d"files.bbs"

          The SETDOS /D[0|1] switch (to disable or enable description
          processing) is still available.

   =>     TYPE:  Will now check for a filename of "NUL" and allow it. 
          However TYPE will trap attempts to type any other character
          device.

   =>     VER:  Displays "(Win 95) DOS" under Windows 95.


   Internal Variables and Variable Functions
   -----------------------------------------

   =>     Added two new internal variables:

                  %_CI           returns the insert-mode cursor shape, as a
                                 percentage (see SETDOS /S)

                  %_CO           returns the overstrike-mode cursor shape,
                                 as a percentage

   =>     %_WIN:  Now returns "30" under Windows NT and "40" under Windows
          95.

   =>     @ATTRIB:  Added an optional third argument.  The new syntax is
          %@ATTRIB[filename[,NRSHA[,p]]].  The 'p' tells ATTRIB to accept a
          partial match; i.e. if the file has "RHA" attributes set:

                  %@ATTRIB[filename,R]          fails, because @ATTRIB
                                                wants an exact match

                  %@ATTRIB[filename,R,p]        succeeds

   =>     @READSCR:  Added offset capability when "+" and "-" are used in
          the row and column (e.g., "READSCR[-2,0,10]").  The ofsset is
          relative to the current cursor position.

   =>     @TIMER:  Now separates the hundredths digits with the default
          country decimal character, not a hard-coded decimal point.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (5.51 rev A)
   ----------------------------------------------------

   =>     The version number now uses the default decimal separator for the
          current country (e.g. "2,51" rather than "2.51" for Germany). 
          This allows you to make numeric comparisons of version numbers in
          the IF and IFF commands.

   =>     Improved compatibility with APPEND in OS/2 DOS sessions.  See
          APPNOTES.DOC for details.

   =>     Fixed a minor bug in UNKNOWN_CMD alias processing which caused
          the command processor to remove the command argument if it was
          (1) an existing file, and (2) not an executable file.

   =>     ?:  Fixed a problem with the ? prompting command only displaying
          the first word of the prompt.

   =>     DEL:  Disabled "fast deletes" with /Q when /A:... is used to
          specify attributes.  Previously the /Q overrode the /A: and the
          attribute settings were ignored.

   =>     DO:  Fixed a problem with ITERATE inside nested IFFs inside DOs.

   =>     FFIND:  Fixed a problem which sometimes caused FFIND to loop
          endlessly printing blank lines; also fixed a problem with FFIND
          not searching past the first 64K of the file in a text search.

   =>     INKEY:  Fixed an obscure problem with combining the /P and /K
          switches and then entering invalid input. 

   =>     LIST:  Fixed a problem with searching through very large pipes
          with LIST /S.

   =>     SCRPUT / VSCRPUT:  Now preserve leading quoted whitespace in the
          text argument.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (5.51 rev B)
   ----------------------------------------------------

   =>     Fixed a problem which caused trouble with QEMM LOADHI on the
          SHELL= line (it still won't work all the time, but that is not a
          4DOS problem), and fixed a related problem with VIDRAM.

   =>     The upper limit for the StackSize .INI directive has been
          increased to 16384 for those running extremely complex batch
          files.  Please note that you may receive "out of memory" errors
          which prevent 4DOS from loading if you use large StackSize values
          along with enlarged alias and/or history buffers.

   =>     Filename completion was incorrectly inserting quotes around
          filenames with embedded ampersands.

   =>     Fixed a problem with long filenames in the LOG /W path.

   =>     Fixed problems with DIR running out of memory when handling large
          directories on drives which support long filenames.

   =>     %_DPMI:  Changed to use the country-dependent decimal character.

   =>     %_WINVER:  Changed to use the country-dependent decimal
          character.

   =>     COPY / MOVE:  Fixed problems with copying files across a network
          from a drive which supports long filenames to a drive which does
          not.  Also modified these commands to use less stack space; this
          should reduce the chance that you will need to increase the
          StackSize setting in 4DOS.INI when processing deeply-nested
          directory structures with COPY /S or MOVE /S.

   =>     DESCRIBE:  Fixed a problem with describing subdirectories.

   =>     DIR:  Fixed some problems with displaying compression ratios on
          DRVSPACE compressed drives under Windows 95.

   =>     FFIND:  Fixed a problem with not clearing the hex flag after a
          previous LIST /X.

   =>     DESCRIBE:  Fixed a problem with describing subdirectories.  Also
          fixed a problem on non-Win95 systems with a command like:

              describe aaa "bbb"

          when "bbb" is also an existing filename.

   =>     QUIT:  Fixed a problem with running "QUIT n" from the command
          line.

   =>     SELECT:  Fixed a problem with page numbering in the SELECT
          display.

   =>     TRUENAME:  Worked around a Windows 95 limitation which prevented
          use of TRUENAME with long filenames.
