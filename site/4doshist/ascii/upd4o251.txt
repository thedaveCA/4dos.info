   Check through this file for a comprehensive list of what's changed since
   version 2.5.  Additional documentation on new features is in the online
   help.

   Some of the descriptions below may be more detailed than you need; if
   you aren't using a feature, feel free to skip to the next item.  If you
   are new to 4OS2 with version 2.51, you can skip this file entirely, and
   begin with the 4OS2 Introduction and Installation Guide.

   This file is divided into the following sections:

          Startup and Initialization
          Command Changes
          Variables and Variable Functions
          Technical and Compatibility Changes
          Bugs Fixed

   Major new features and those which affect most users are marked with
   "**" in the lists below.  Other items discuss smaller or more technical
   changes.

   This file may cover multiple revisions (e.g. version 2.51A, 2.51B,
   etc.).  Most items refer to changes made in the initial release,
   revision A.  Any item with a revision letter in the left margin (e.g. an
   item marked with "=>B") was added or updated in that revision.  Minor
   technical, compatibility, and bug fixes for each revision 5.51are listed
   at the end of the file.

   This file is formatted at 58 lines per page, and contains form feeds and
   page footers.  It can be viewed with a file viewer such as the 4OS2 LIST
   command, or printed on most PC printers using the command:

                  copy updat251.doc prn

   Printing it with a program that formats the pages is not likely to work
   due to the formatting included in the file.

                             4OS2 2.51 Change List


   Startup and Initialization
   --------------------------

   =>     Added two new .INI directives:

              ListExit = Key (Esc):  Allows you to map the keystroke used
              to exit the LIST command.

              SwapFilePath = Path:  (4OS2/32 only) Specifies the path to
              the swap file (if it's NOT in \os2\system) so the MEMORY
              command can find it.


   Command Changes
   ---------------

   => **  COPY / DEL / MOVE / REN:  When using the prompt (/P) option, an
          ESCAPE will now cancel further processing for that argument,
          rather than canceling prompting and continuing with the
          operation.

   =>B**  DIR / SELECT:  Colorizing filenames with no extension wasn't
          specifically covered before, though you could do it by using
          "*:color" to color everything.  You can also now specify files
          without extensions using the syntax " :color".  For example, the
          following ColorDir setting in the .INI file will color EXE files
          red, TXT files bright red, and files with no extension bright
          cyan:

   =>     GOSUB / GOTO:  Made a change to try to accommodate both the old
          label style (first word only) and the new style that permits
          multi-word labels.

   =>     IFF:  Changed the way the command processor handles piping to
          IFF.  You can now pipe to an IFF and the pipe information will be
          passed to the command(s) following the IFF (previously it was
          ignored).

   =>B    LIST:  Now defaults to listing (all files ("*.*") if the argument
          is a directory name.  Also printing the file now displays a
          header (filename, date, and time) on the first page, and GOTO now
          supports negative offsets -- for example you can enter "-10" to
          go back 10 lines.  When using negative offsets, the number of
          lines moved will not correspond accurately to the line count in
          the LIST status bar when the LIST display is wrapped.






   4OS2 2.51  [10-17-95]         UPDAT251.DOC                        page 2


   =>     ON:  Added a new ON ERRORMSG option.  ON ERRORMSG is the same as
          ON ERROR, but displays the usual error message before executing
          the specified command (ON ERROR suppresses the error message).

   =>     SETDOS:  You can now change the default description filename with
          the SETDOS /D switch.  If the /D is followed by a double quote,
          the string inside the quotes will be used as the description
          file.  For example:

                  setdos /d"files.bbs"

          The SETDOS /D[0|1] switch (to disable or enable description
          processing) is still available.

   =>     TYPE:  Will now check for a filename of "NUL" and allow it. 
          However TYPE will trap attempts to type any other character
          device.


   Internal Variables and Variable Functions
   -----------------------------------------

   =>     Added two new internal variables:

                  %_CI           returns the insert-mode cursor shape, as a
                                 percentage (see SETDOS /S)

                  %_CO           returns the overstrike-mode cursor shape,
                                 as a percentage

   =>     @ATTRIB:  Added an optional third argument.  The new syntax is
          %@ATTRIB[filename[,NRSHA[,p]]].  The 'p' tells ATTRIB to accept a
          partial match; i.e. if the file has "RHA" attributes set:

                  %@ATTRIB[filename,R]          fails, because @ATTRIB
                                                wants an exact match

                  %@ATTRIB[filename,R,p]        succeeds

   =>     @READSCR:  Added offset capability when "+" and "-" are used in
          the row and column (e.g., "READSCR[-2,0,10]").  The ofsset is
          relative to the current cursor position.

   =>     @TIMER:  Now separates the hundredths digits with the default
          country decimal character, not a hard-coded decimal point.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (2.51 rev A)
   ----------------------------------------------------

   => **  4OS2/32 supports IBM's BeginLIBPath and EndLIBPath variables
          implemented in OS/2 Warp.



   4OS2 2.51  [10-17-95]         UPDAT251.DOC                        page 3


   =>     The version number now uses the default decimal separator for the
          current country (e.g. "2,51" rather than "2.51" for Germany).

   =>     Trailing whitespace is now stripped from quoted HPFS names, for
          compatibility with CMD.EXE.

   =>     Improved operation of batch files when they are run inside a
          pipe.

   => **  Directory colorization now looks for the last '.' in the filename
          (rather than the first) to determine the extension for HPFS
          files.

   =>     Fixed a minor bug in UNKNOWN_CMD alias processing which caused
          the command processor to remove the command argument if it was
          (1) an existing file, and (2) not an executable file.

   =>     Worked around an OS/2 pipe bug that would sometimes display
          leftover 4START.BTM lines after piping to LIST /S.

   =>     ?:  Fixed a problem with the ? prompting command only displaying
          the first word of the prompt.

   =>     DO:  Fixed a problem with ITERATE inside nested IFFs inside DOs.

   =>     FFIND:  Fixed a problem which sometimes caused FFIND to loop
          endlessly printing blank lines; also fixed a problem with FFIND
          not searching past the first 64K of the file in a text search.

   =>     INKEY:  Fixed an obscure problem with combining the /P and /K
          switches and then entering invalid input. 

   =>     SCRPUT / VSCRPUT:  Now preserve leading quoted whitespace in the
          text argument.


   Technical, Compatibility, and Bug Fixes (2.51 rev B)
   ----------------------------------------------------

   =>     Fixed a problem with %@ATTRIB which made it work with one
          argument or three arguments, but fail with two (4OS2/32 only).

   =>     Fixed a problem with returning errorlevels from piped processes
          inside REXX files.

   =>     Fixed a problem when piping in a nested batch file with SETLOCAL
          invoked in the parent batch file.

   =>     ** Fixed problems with BEGINLIBPATH / ENDLIBPATH in some versions
          of Warp.  The fix is in the new file 4OS2DLL.DLL, which is now
          required if you use BEGINLIBPATH / ENDLIBPATH.




   4OS2 2.51  [10-17-95]         UPDAT251.DOC                        page 4


   =>     Fixed a problem with long filenames in the LOG /W path.

   =>     Fixed an occasional problem with listing extremely large files
          (4OS2/32 only).

   =>     %_DPMI:  Changed to use the country-dependent decimal character.

   =>     FFIND:  Fixed a problem with not clearing the hex flag after a
          previous LIST /X.

   =>     GOSUB / GOTO:  Now search for labels starting at the current
          position and working toward the end of the file, then restart the
          search at the beginning of the file if necessary (for
          compatibility with CMD.EXE).

   =>     QUIT:  Fixed a problem with running "QUIT n" from the command
          line.

   =>     SELECT:  Fixed a problem with page numbering in the SELECT
          display.
