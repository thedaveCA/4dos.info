 Sharing Environment Variables under Windows 9x

          Methods for setting an environment variable in one 4DOS
          session under Windows 95/98, and retrieving it from another:

          (1) Set the variable in the 4DOS master environment and
              retrieve it with the %@MASTER function:

                Batch file in session 1:

                        ...
                        set /m var=value
                        ...

                Batch file in session 2:

                        ...
                        set var=%@master[var]
                        ...

          (2) Save the variable name and value to a file and retrieve
              it with SET /R:

                Batch file in session 1:

                      ...
                      set var=value
                      ...
                      echo var=%var > d:\path\filename
                      ...

                Batch file in session 2:

                      ...
                      set /r d:\path\filename
                      ...

          (3) Set the variable in the Windows master environment with
              Microsoft's WINSET so that it is automatically passed to
              the second session.

                Batch file in session 1:

                      ...
                      winset var=value
                      ...

                Batch file in session 2:

                      ...
                      [no special processing needed,
                                just use the variable]
                      ...

          In most cases the simplest method is probably #1.  The only
          requirement for this method is that you load 4DOS as the
          primary shell in CONFIG.SYS (see the manual or help for
          details on this and other 4DOS configuration issues under
          Windows 95/98).

          Notes for method #3:

          - You must find and install Microsoft's WINSET.EXE program
            from the Windows 95/98 CD.  For Win95 it's in the
            "\admin\apptools\envvars\" directory, and for Win98 in the
            "\tools\reskit\scrpting\" directory.  You may also be able
            to find the program on the Internet.

          - The second session cannot be started until after WINSET is
            run in the first session.  Under the other methods you can
            start the sessions in any sequence you like, and the only
            timing requirement is the obvious one that you can't use
            the variable in session 2 until after it has been set in
            session 1.
