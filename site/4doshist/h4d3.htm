    Enhancements:</font></b><p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Verdana" size="2">
    Installation and Configuration</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The 4DOS loader (4DOS.COM) has been completely 
      rewritten. It now takes a little under 3K of low memory (less than 
      COMMAND.COM!). In version 2.21 it required close to 5K.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now supports swapping to XMS extended 
      memory. In order for it to work you must have an XMS driver such as 
      HIMEM.SYS loaded, or an equivalent program such as 386MAX or QEMM 5.0.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The resident portion of 4DOS and the master 
      environment can now be loaded high if your hardware and software support 
      XMS Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs). If both options are used 4DOS's low-memory 
      footprint can be reduced to as little as 256 bytes. See the options 
      section below for details.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The 4DOS loader now distinguishes processor 
      types more carefully when loading the EXE file. 4DOS286.EXE (which in fact 
      runs on any 80186 / 188 or later processor) will now automatically be 
      loaded for all processors other than 8086 / 88. This should make NEC V20 / 
      V30 systems run 4DOS286 automatically.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The loader now displays the size of the swap 
      area being used in K, e.g. &quot;EMS swapping initialized (80K)&quot;.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">IF 4DOS is swapping to EMS and your EMS driver 
      supports the LIM EMS 4.0 specification, EMS swapping blocks will be named 
      4DOS:nnn where nnn is the shell nesting level (000 for the primary shell).&nbsp;Previously the blocks were unnamed. They will remain unnamed on EMS 3.2 
      systems.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Errors detected by the low memory portion of 
      4DOS are now quite cryptic, to save space in low memory. They all read 
      simply &quot;4DOS error XX&quot;. See the Error Messages appendix in the manual for 
      the meaning of the codes.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Aliases and Environment:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Aliases are now in a separate block, whose size 
      is defined with the new SHELL and 4DSHELL parameter /A:nnnn. You will need 
      to add this parameter, and probably reduce your environment size 
      accordingly.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Since aliases are in a separate block, there is 
      little need to swap out the master copy of the environment to save space. 
      Therefore 4DOS defaults to a memory-resident master environment (formerly 
      selected with the /M command line option), whether you specify the 
      environment size with /E or /M.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Command Line Options:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The new /A:nnnn switch specifies the size of the 
      alias buffer, in<br>
      bytes.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The history and environment limits have been 
      changed. The new values for environment, aliases, and history are (all in 
      bytes): </font>
      <p><font color="#0000CC"><br>
      <font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p>&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The /M switch is obsolete, but will still be 
      accepted. It is equivalent to /E.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">/E:nnnn may be followed by U (/E:nnnnU) to load 
      the master environment into a UMB in high DOS memory. See the information 
      on /U below regarding hardware/software compatibility and UMB access.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The new /U switch requests that 4DOS load its 
      resident portion into an Upper Memory Block (UMB) at the high end of DOS 
      memory.
      You must have the appropriate hardware and XMS driver software for this 
      option to work; if you don't the resident portion will simply be loaded 
      normally in low memory. See COMPAT.DOC for the latest details on what 
      hardware and software is required for 4DOS to access UMBs.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Technical Information on Installation:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS.COM has been modified to set the PSP memory 
      size, rather than relying on DOS to do it properly. This allows 4DOS's 
      swapping mode to work properly in the OS/2 compatibility box.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The critical error and ctrl-C / ctrl-break 
      handlers are now in low memory all the time. Previously they were in high 
      memory, and switched to low memory when an application was run. This 
      should solve some compatibility problems with programs that wanted these 
      handlers to be in low memory and/or to have their addresses fixed, rather 
      than changing each time an application was run. </font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now hooks interrupt 2E (in the primary 
      shell only). Some programs use this to find the root command processor 
      and/or global master environment. Note 4DOS does NOT process INT 2E in any 
      way, it just returns. But it does hook it.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC"><b>Features and Usage</b><br>
    <br>
    General Features:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">&quot;4DOS286&quot; is now compiled in 186-compatible mode 
      to assure compatibility with NEC V20/V30 microprocessors. This does not 
      affect the speed or size of the EXE file.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The functions that accept multiple arguments 
      (COPY, MOVE, DEL, RENAME, etc.) no longer abort on an error - they will 
      continue processing the remainder of the arguments, and then return an 
      error. This will allow things like DEL *.BAK to continue when a read-only 
      file exists among the .BAK files and cannot be deleted.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">SHARE / LAN support has been added for all file 
      I/O. (For example, LIST and TYPE open their files in &quot;deny write&quot; mode; 
      other systems can still read the files, but can't write them while LIST 
      and TYPE are using them). This change should be transparent to most users 
      but will improve compatibility on some networks.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The ctrl-C / ctrl-Break handler has been cleaned 
      up and should be more reliable.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now supports the DOS 4.0 DOSSHELL command 
      without the use of special batch files, COMMAND.COM, etc.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">A bug in the 4DOS beep subroutine could cause 
      the beep issued for an invalid keystroke or any other reason to stay on 
      indefinitely when running a multitasker with background processing active 
      (e.g. DESQView, VM/386), or when using PC Magazine's ANSI.COM version 1.2. 
      This has been fixed.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now issues a specific interrupt just after 
      displaying the prompt and before accepting input. This allows TSRs to tell 
      when 4DOS is back at the prompt. The interrupt call is an INT 2F with AX = 
      0D44Eh. Any routine intercepting this should preserve at least the SI, DI, 
      BP, SP, DS, ES, and SS registers.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The program name passed to DOS for external 
      programs is now set to upper case. Previously some external programs could 
      not find their own name as they were not written to handle lower case. 
      This resulted in errors in finding overlay files and other similar 
      problems.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">If the screen width in the BIOS is 0, 4DOS now 
      defaults to 80, to accommodate the TI Professional.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The date, time, and thousands separator 
      characters are now set by the default country definition (in DOS 3+). 
      Previously the country definition only affected the date and time format.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Previously 4DOS sometimes failed to ask ask 
      &quot;Cancel batch file&quot; when aborting via ^C from an external program. This 
      has been fixed.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Command Line Editing:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The ^D (delete) command now displays the 
      previous history command after deleting the current one.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">A new command, ^E (end), moves to the last entry 
      in the history list and displays it.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Filename completion (F9 / F10 keys) has two 
      changes:<br>
&nbsp;</font><ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">The F8 key will now return the previous 
        matching filename if you go past the filename you want in the list.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">When scanning the directory for filename 
        completion 4DOS now starts with the name you type (if any) and appends a 
        &quot;*.*&quot; if no extension is given (as it used to), and also a &quot;*&quot; if an 
        extension is given (that's the new part). This makes names like &quot;FILE.E&quot; 
        expand as &quot;FILE.E*&quot;. </font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Command Parsing:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The command line parser has been completely 
      rewritten. (The&nbsp; parser is the part of 4DOS that reads your commands 
      and analyzes them for aliases, environment variables, program names, 
      switches, etc.). It now supports multiple commands and redirection more 
      gracefully. Specific changes are listed below:</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">When entering multiple commands on the line, 
      each command is parsed just before it is executed. (This is true at the 
      prompt, in aliases, and in batch files.) Previously all commands on the 
      line were parsed before any of them were executed. </font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">As a result, environment variable and alias 
      changes made in one command now take effect immediately, and will affect 
      the parsing of commands later on the same line. Previously these changes 
      did not take effect until the entire line had been parsed.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The 255-character command limit now applies to 
      each individual command as it is expanded, and to the original command 
      line. Previously the entire command line after alias and variable 
      expansion had to fit within 255 characters as well.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">EXCEPT, FOR, GLOBAL, IF, and SELECT now accept 
      aliases as the command argument.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Filename parsing has been modified to allow a 
      forward slash (&quot;/&quot;) as a path separator in most places. However commands 
      which use &quot;/&quot; for switches may still get confused if you use this 
      construct. </font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">&quot;Whitespace&quot; (delimiter) characters (;=,) 
      following the command name are no longer skipped for the first command 
      line argument, but still are for the second argument onwards. This allows 
      commands like &quot;XYZ,,,,,&quot; to pass white space characters (comma is a 
      whitespace character in DOS) correctly to an external program.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The parser's memory handling has been rewritten 
      to eliminate &quot;stack overflow&quot; errors with long aliases. </font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">You can now disable the saving of a specific 
      command to the history list by prefacing the command with &quot;@&quot;.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Filenames ending with a &quot;\&quot; are now assumed to 
      be directory names, i.e., &quot;C:\4DOS\&quot; is equivalent to &quot;C:\4DOS\*.*&quot;. This 
      allows you to force 4DOS to consider something to be a directory name 
      rather than a file name if there may be ambiguity.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Alias expansion will now take place even when 
      the first item on
      the line is an environment variable. Previously executing &quot;%var&quot;
      as a command would not work when the variable contained an alias
      name.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">ECHOing of the command line now occurs before 
      piping. This allows commands like &quot;echo y | del *.*&quot; to work when ECHO is 
      on.&nbsp; Previously these commands would pipe the ECHO command itself, 
      instead of the Y, to the following command, and the command would not 
      behave properly.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The parser has been modified to not treat 
      parentheses as special characters; FOR, EXCEPT, and SELECT have been 
      modified to do their parentheses parsing internally. This fixes a problem 
      with renaming files whose names start with a left parenthesis.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Aliases:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Alias expansion has been changed slightly. 
      Previously, if you had variables in an alias (%1, %2, ...) then once 
      variable substitution was complete 4DOS would discard the remainder of the 
      command line. Now, 4DOS discards the command line up to and including the 
      highest referenced variable, and appends the rest of the line to the end 
      of the expanded command.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Batch Files:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">A new extension to support &quot;in memory batch 
      files&quot; has been added (.BTM = &quot;batch to memory&quot;). The features of .BTM 
      files are:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</font><ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">The file will be loaded into memory and then 
        executed without requiring further disk I/O. This will be 2 - 5x faster 
        than the approach used for .BAT files (to retain compatibility with 
        COMMAND.COM), where the file is closed and reopened for each line.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">You can now remove the disk containing an 
        original .BTM file without having to worry about the &quot;Missing batch 
        file&quot; message.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">.BTM files are limited to 64K bytes in size.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">Do not load TSRs (memory-resident programs) 
        from a .BTM file. If you do the memory released when the .BTM file is 
        done will leave a &quot;hole&quot; in memory below the TSR. This is not harmful, 
        but it wastes memory.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">Self-modifying batch files can NOT be 
        converted to .BTM files.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">4START can now be a .BAT or .BTM file.</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Batch file variable %0 now returns the batch 
      file name as it was entered on the command line, in upper case, just like 
      COMMAND.COM. This should fix compatibility problems with some installation 
      batch files.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The %# variable has been added to batch files. 
      It returns the number of command line arguments (%1 - %n).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">I/O Redirection:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Redirection is now fully nestable. For example, 
      invoking a batch file XYZ with &quot;XYZ &gt; OUT.DAT&quot; will redirect all output 
      from the batch file to OUT.DAT unless additional redirection is 
      encountered&nbsp;&nbsp; within the batch file.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The EXCEPT, FOR, GLOBAL, and SELECT commands now 
      handle I/O redirection when processing begins for the second command 
      (previously it was handled when the EXCEPT, FOR, GLOBAL, or SELECT was 
      processed). In FOR, this allows you to redirect output to a file whose 
      name depends on the FOR variable.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Redirection of STDERR only has been added. The 
      syntax is &quot;&gt;&amp;&gt; filename&quot; to redirect STDERR to a file, or &quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;&gt; filename&quot; 
      to append STDERR to a file.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now checks for duplicate redirection (i.e., 
      &quot;DIR &gt; 1.DAT &gt; 2.DAT&quot;). Previously duplicate redirection would end up with 
      output permanently redirected to never-never land once the command was 
      finished.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Environment Variables:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">VERY IMPORTANT: The 4DOS internal variables (CWD, 
      CWDS, DOSVER, etc.) are now prefixed with an underscore (_). This should 
      reduce conflicts with your own environment variables of the same name. You 
      must modify any batch files or aliases which use these variables or they 
      will not work properly with 4DOS 3.0. The only variables 4DOS uses which 
      are NOT prefixed with an underscore are the ones which are actually 
      inserted in the environment: PATH, COMSPEC, 4DSHELL, TMP, etc.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Many new internal variables have been added; see 
      the manual and README.DOC for an up-to-date list of all variables. 
      Additions include:<br>
      <br>
      %? Exit code of last external program<br>
      %_bg, %_fg Current screen colors<br>
      %_cpu CPU type<br>
      %_cwp, %_cwps Like %_cwd and %_cwds but without the drive<br>
      %_shell Current shell nesting level<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Variables you insert into the environment with 
      SET or in any other way now override 4DOS internal variables of the same 
      name (%_CWD, %_DATE, etc.).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">A new internal &quot;function variable&quot; type has been 
      added. These functions allow you to parse strings. See the manual for full 
      details. The functions are:<br>
      <br>
      %@ext[filename] Get extension part of filename<br>
      %@full[filename] Get full file name<br>
      %@len[string] Get the length of a string<br>
      %@line[filename,n] Get line n from a file (see README.DOC, not described 
      in manual)<br>
      %@name[filename] Get name part of filename<br>
      %@path[filename] Get path part of filename<br>
      %@search[filename] Search the path<br>
      %@substr[string,start,len] Extract a substring<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The '$' character has been added to the valid 
      variable name<br>
      character list.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The new syntax %[varname] will accept any 
      sequence of characters as a valid environment variable name for expansion. 
      This will override both the assumption that a variable is a batch or alias 
      argument if it starts with a digit, and the restrictions on what 
      characters are normally considered part of a variable name.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Commands</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">ALIAS: Lines beginning with a colon (&quot;:&quot;) are 
      now ignored in ALIAS /R files; this allows you to add comments to the 
      files.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">ATTRIB: No longer changes subdirectory 
      attributes unless the new /D(irectory) switch is used.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">BEEP: Now uses the default duration of 2/18 
      second if no duration is specified. Will no longer hang with the speaker 
      on when a task switch occurs in a multitasking system (DESQView, VM/386, 
      etc.).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">CD and CDD: Added support for Netware-like args 
      &quot;...&quot; to change to the directory two levels up, &quot;....&quot; to go three levels 
      up, etc.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">CLS: Now allows color specification if ANSI.SYS 
      is installed, e.g. CLS BRIGHT WHITE ON BLUE.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">COLOR: This is a new command to set the screen 
      colors. You must have an ANSI driver (ANSI.SYS or equivalent) loaded.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">COPY: There are a number of changes:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</font><ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">Three switches have been added: /Q(uiet) to 
        turn off the display of files copied, /R(eplace) to prompt before 
        overwriting an existing file, and /U(pdate) to copy the file only if the 
        target doesn't exist or is older than the source.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/A and /B are now COMMAND.COM-compatible: When 
        copying to a character device (e.g. PRN), /A or /B anywhere on the line 
        will treat all files in the specified mode. When copying to a file, the 
        /A and /B switches apply only to the immediately previous filespec 
        (whether it is for source or target), and all subsequent ones on that 
        line. (Note that if you are copying multiple files and mix /A and /B on 
        the same line, all kinds of things can happen. None of them are &quot;wrong&quot; 
        but they may not be what you want.)</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">A problem with DOS 2 not recognizing source 
        devices properly has been fixed.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">CTTY: Now uses the DOS get line call (INT 21h 
      function 0Ah) to get input. This should permit crude line editing with the 
      backspace and ESC keys. Even this level of line editing was not possible 
      under the old CTTY.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DEL: Two switches have been added. /Q(uiet) 
      turns off the display of files deleted. /Y(es) skips the &quot;Are you sure&quot; 
      prompt for commands like &quot;DEL *.*&quot; -- use it with caution!.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DELAY: This is a new command. It waits specified 
      number of seconds and then continues; it can be used to delay for an 
      external event in a batch file.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DESCRIBE: This command now lists only normal and 
      read-only files and directories, and does not not list hidden / system 
      files. <br>
      Also the file description write is now to 2 - 20 times faster,&nbsp; 
      depending on the size of the description file.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DIR: There are many changes:</font><ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/4 is a new switch to give a 4-column 
        directory display.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/A(ttrib) display format has been changed to 
        use standard 1-column format, with the attributes in place of the file 
        description.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/V(ertical) sort now creates newspaper-style 
        columns when invoked along with /2, /4, or /W and /P(ause). Previously 
        DIR /2VP (for example) would create two long columns, not divided by 
        page.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">DIR now has an &quot;include list&quot; format, e.g. DIR 
        *.WKS+*.DAT to display all specified files in one list. Previously 
        without the &quot;+&quot; there would be two separate lists displayed.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">The directory scan now allocates memory in 
        larger blocks.&nbsp; This should speed up DIR a bit on 8088 systems, and 
        improve reliability on some networks which couldn't handle many small 
        memory allocation requests properly.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">Internal memory allocation for DIR has been 
        rewritten so that the limit on the number of files it can handle is now 
        based only on available memory. The previous limit was just over 1000 
        files.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">Subdirectory sizes are now excluded from the 
        summary totals.&nbsp; This gets around a bug in Netware 386 which 
        returns about 2 billion bytes as the size of a subdirectory!</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">If the file time is exactly 00:00:00 no time 
        is displayed, just like under COMMAND.COM.</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DRAWBOX, DRAWHLINE, DRAWVLINE: These new 
      commands draw boxes and lines on the display. Color control is included, 
      and connectors are generated automatically when two lines intersect.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">ESET: When editing aliases with truncated names 
      the whole alias is now displayed. For example if you have an alias WHER*EIS 
      and say ESET WHER the editing line will now show the whole name, WHER*EIS, 
      not just WHER like it did before.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">FOR has several changes:</font><ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">A slight change in variable parsing was made 
        to emulate COMMAND.COM, which only allows FOR variables to be 1 
        character long. When these variables had other text added to them 4DOS 
        couldn't find the variable name. Single-character FOR variables will now 
        work properly with text appended to the variable name (e.g. FOR %%X IN 
        (A B C) DO COPY %%Xfile D:).</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">The DO in the FOR syntax is now optional.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">FOR variables may now be specified either as 
        %%var or %var whether the command is issued at the prompt or from a 
        batch file. Previously two percent signs were required in either place.</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">GOTO and GOSUB: These commands now take effect 
      immediately when there are multiple commands on a single line.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">HISTORY: A new switch, /R(ead) allows you to 
      read the history from a file (generally this will be one created via 
      HISTORY &gt; filename.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">IF: There are new IF conditions which allow you 
      to test for file attributes (including volume label), monitor and video 
      card types, free memory of various types (DOS, EMS, XMS, extended), free 
      disk space, file size, and existence of an alias. </font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">IFF: This is probably the single most powerful 
      new feature of version 3.0. It is a block-structured command allowing IFF 
      / THEN / ELSE / ELSEIFF structures in batch files and aliases. The syntax 
      is straightforward:<br>
&nbsp;</font><p><font color="#0000CC"><font face="Courier New">IFF condition 
      then<br>
      command(s)<br>
      ELSE[IFF]<br>
      command(s)<br>
      ...<br>
      ENDIFF<br>
      <br>
      </font>See the manual for further details.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">INKEY: A new switch has been added, /Wn (wait), 
      to wait up to n seconds for a reply. If the time elapses without any 
      entry, the&nbsp; command returns without modifying the variable. /W0 
      returns immediately whether or not a keystroke is pending, and thus can be 
      used to test for a pending keystroke.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">INPUT: A /W has switch has been added as for 
      INKEY. /W0 returns immediately if no keystroke is pending, and waits for 
      the rest of the string if a keystroke is pending.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">KEYSTACK: A longstanding bug has been fixed. 
      KEYSTACK was randomly trashing a word somewhere in memory. While this was 
      rarely causing trouble, the fix may help with some KEYSTACK compatibility 
      problems.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">LIST: There are several changes:</font><ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">The function keys have been changed. F1 
        (search) and F2 (search again) have been changed to F5 and F6 to avoid 
        confusion with HELP. F4 (print file) has been changed to F7. There are 
        two new switches. /S(TDIN) gets input from standard input instead of a 
        file. This allows you to pipe the output from another command to LIST 
        for full-screen viewing, e.g. DIR | LIST /S. /W(rap) wraps all lines at 
        the right side of the screen, which is useful for viewing non-text 
        files.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">EGA and VGA display speed has been increased.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">The Ctrl-Right Arrow and Ctrl-Left Arrow keys 
        can now be used to shift left or right 40 columns at a time (the arrow 
        keys alone shift 8 columns at a time as before).</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">LOG: This is a new command which allows you to 
      log all commands entered at the prompt to a log file, with date and time 
      stamps. You can enables or disable logging, write text to the log file, 
      and set its name.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">MEMORY: The display includes several new items: 
      the total and free XMS memory; whether the High Memory Area (HMA, a part 
      of the XMS specification) is free; the total and free alias space, and the 
      history list size.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">MOVE: There are two new switches: /Q(uiet) turns 
      off the display of files moved; /R(eplace) prompts before overwriting an 
      existing file.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">PATH: The path is now saved in upper case to 
      work around a Novell Netware bug. The bug causes loss of the local path 
      when mapping network drives, if the local path is stored in lower case.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">PROMPT: Now checks for a null current directory 
      to prevent displaying garbage when the current drive is changed to a drive 
      that isn't ready. Also there are some changes to the &quot;$&quot; strings you can 
      use:</font><ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">--&gt; $a (ampersand) has been removed to avoid a 
        problem with ProComm, which uses $a as an invalid character in order to 
        generate a space in the prompt. If you need an ampersand in your prompt, 
        just use the &quot;&amp;&quot; character instead of $a.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">$xd: is a new function which displays the 
        current directory for the specified drive. For example, to display the 
        current directory on drive E:, include $xe: in the prompt string. </font>
        </li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">Using $Xd: instead of $xd: will display the 
        directory in upper case.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">$z is a new function which displays the 4DOS 
        shell nesting level (0 for the primary shell, 99 for memory-resident 
        copies of 4DOS).</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">PUSHD / POPD: The directory stack now discards 
      the oldest entries when full and &quot;wraps around&quot; -- previously an error was 
      generated if the directory stack overflowed. Also, PUSHD now supports 
      Netware-like args as in CD and CDD: &quot;...&quot; to change to the directory two 
      levels up, &quot;....&quot; to go three levels up, etc.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">REN: The new /Q(uiet) switch turns off the 
      display of the files renamed.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">REM: Remarks are now parsed before alias and 
      variable expansion, so you can have any number of unmatched quotes in the 
      REM statement without an error message. Previously any unmatched quotes 
      would cause a &quot;No closing quote&quot; error.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">SCRPUT: This new command to writes text directly 
      to the screen, and includes color control and cursor positioning.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">SELECT: There are several changes: </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">Files can now be marked with the spacebar, and 
        pressing the spacebar or &quot;+&quot; on a marked file will unmark it. The F1 key 
        will call up 4DOS HELP from inside SELECT.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">SELECT now has an &quot;include list&quot; format, e.g. 
        SELECT COPY (*.WKS+*.DAT) A: to display all specified files in one list.&nbsp; 
        Previously without the &quot;+&quot; there would be two separate lists displayed.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">The SELECT header has been redesigned. The 
        entire command you typed is now displayed on the second line, instead of 
        just the filespec (if you have more than about 64 characters in the 
        command line, the display will be truncated). The header now shows the 
        length of the command line as well; this is especially useful when using 
        SELECT with [] as it is easy to get the command line to long for 
        external commands (126- character limit) or internal commands (255 
        characters).</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">It is now possible to use SELECT with only one 
        parameter, e.g. SELECT (*.BAT) to choose a batch file to run.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">A bug which sometimes hung the system in 
        SELECT if the command line got too long has been fixed.</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">SET has two new switches: /P(ause) pauses after 
      each page of display; &quot;/R filename&quot; reads the environment variables from a 
      file (similar to ALIAS /R).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">SETDOS: There are five new switches: </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/A(NSI) forces 4DOS to assume ANSI.SYS is 
        installed, even if it appears not to be. /A1 enables this, /A0 returns 
        to automatic detection of ANSI.SYS and is the default.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/I(nternal) is used to disable or re-enable a 
        4DOS internal command. /I-cmd disables &quot;cmd&quot;, /I+cmd re-enables it.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/L(ine input) forces 4DOS to read input one 
        line at a time, instead of the usual one character at a time. This may 
        be necessary for compatibility with some programs; see COMPAT.DOC for 
        details. /L1 enables line input; /L0 disables it and is the default.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/U(pper) forces all filenames to be displayed 
        in upper case in all commands and error messages. /U1 forces upper case; 
        /U0 is the default and enables lower case output.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">/W sets the DOS and 4DOS switch character. 
        This new switch is described in README.DOC, but is not included in the 
        manual. Be sure to read the cautionary note in README.DOC before using 
        this switch!</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">SHIFT: This command has been modified to prevent 
      execution except while in a batch file.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">SWAPPING: This is a new command which turns 
      swapping ON or OFF.&nbsp; Turning swapping off locks the transient portion 
      of 4DOS in high memory. This improves performance on systems running disk 
      swapping, especially when running lots of little programs (e.g. during 
      AUTOEXEC). Turning swapping off will not close the disk swap file or 
      deallocate reserved EMS or XMS memory. Entering the command with no 
      arguments displays the current swapping status. </font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">TIME: Now supports the COMMAND.COM &quot;AM / PM&quot; 
      syntax as well as 24-hour time syntax. Also a bug was fixed which caused 
      the hundredths of a second to be set to random values, some good, some not 
      so good.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">UNSET: This new command removes environment 
      variables (like UNALIAS does for aliases). To clear the entire 
      environment, use &quot;UNSET *&quot; -- but do so with caution, it will remove PATH, 
      COMSPEC, and other essential information!</font></li>

    <font color="#0000CC" face="Verdana" size="2">General 
    Enhancements:</font><ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Disk swapping should no longer cause occasional 
      system hangs if the Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break key is hit while 4DOS is swapping 
      itself in from disk (i.e. when exiting an application).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">CLS, LIST, and SELECT are no longer affected by 
      a video BIOS bug in old IBM PCs.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Command Line Options:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Either / or - may be used as the switch 
      character on the 4DOS command line (eg SHELL=4DOS -S:E instead of /S:E, 
      etc.).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Option files (@filename):<br>
      <br>
      The new @filename option allows you to put 4DOS options into a disk file 
      instead of specifying them on the SHELL= line in CONFIG.SYS. This gets 
      around a bug in DOS which limits the length of the SHELL= line.<br>
      <br>
      The file specified in the &quot;@filename&quot; option can have more than one line, 
      and is limited to a total of 255 characters in the file, not 128. A file 
      invoked with @filename can have another @filename inside it. Wherever 
      @filename occurs, all options placed after it are ignored, so it must be 
      the last item present.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Alias size (/A):<br>
      <br>
      Aliases are now in a separate block, whose size in bytes is defined with 
      the new SHELL and 4DSHELL parameter /A:nnnn. You will need to add this 
      parameter, and probably reduce your environment size accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      The /A switch supports the same incremental syntax used with /E, i.e. /A+n. 
      When used in 4DSHELL this allows you to guarantee a specified amount of 
      free alias space in<br>
      secondary shells.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Environment size (/E):<br>
      <br>
      4DOS now defaults to a memory-resident master environment (formerly 
      selected with the /M command line option). The /M switch is therefore 
      obsolete, but will still be accepted. It is equivalent to /E.<br>
      <br>
      /E:nnnn may also be followed by S (/E:nnnnS) to swap the master copy of 
      the environment; this is equivalent to the 4DOS version 2 /E option. This 
      will save a small amount of low memory, but may not be compatible with all 
      applications, and will not work with any application that needs to modify 
      the master environment.<br>
      <br>
      /E:nnnn may be followed by U (/E:nnnnU) to load the master environment 
      into a UMB in high DOS memory. This switch is subject to the same 
      compatibility restrictions as /U (below).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Reduced swap size:<br>
      <br>
      4DOS will normally reduce the space used to swap a secondary shell by 
      retrieving static information from the primary shell's swap area. This 
      reduces secondary shell swap size from 68K or more to about 20K. This 
      feature will not work if the total of your alias, history, and environment 
      sizes in the secondary shell is larger than that specified for the primary 
      shell, or if the size of DOS memory has been reduced when the secondary 
      shell is started (e.g. by a program like DESQView that reserves some 
      memory at the top end of DOS memory). In such cases secondary shells will 
      require<br>
      a full-size swap area. The size of the swap area is dis played in the 
      &quot;swapping initialized (nnK)&quot; message when 4DOS starts.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Disk swapping (/S:D):<br>
      <br>
      The default location for disk swap files in secondary --&gt; shells is now in 
      the root directory of the drive specified in the COMSPEC environment 
      variable (the drive where 4DOS.COM is stored). If you want disk swap files 
      to go to another drive or directory, use the &quot;/S:Bd:\path&quot; or &quot;/S:Dd:\path&quot; 
      settings in the 4DSHELL environment variable (see page 25 of the manual). 
      This should cut down on swap file clutter, yet leave you with complete 
      control over swap file location. </font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Load high (/U):<br>
      <br>
      The new /U switch requests that 4DOS load its resident portion into an 
      Upper Memory Block (UMB) at the high end of DOS memory, reducing low 
      memory usage to 256 bytes. <br>
      <br>
      The /U switch requires 386MAX, QRAM, or QEMM 5.0 or above. It may not be 
      compatible with all other software products. See COMPAT.DOC for full 
      details on compatibility.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><font color="#0000CC">Features and Usage</font></b></p>
    <p><font color="#0000CC"><br>
    General Features:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now has better support for non-English 
      characters in filenames, environment variables, and aliases.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Most of the changes in version 3.0 to allow 
      shareable file access on networks have been removed, because some networks 
      and a few popular programs (e.g. SHARE and FASTOPEN) couldn't handle them 
      properly. SHARE/LAN support is now provided where possible, but is avoided 
      in many places where it has been found to cause trouble. This change 
      should eliminate most or all I/O redirection problems on networks.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">A number of changes have been made to increase 
      4DOS's execution speed, and reduce its size slightly. Speed improvements 
      are primarily in the areas of file access (particularly .BAT files)and 
      environment variable and alias expansion. They may not be noticeable on 
      higher-speed systems.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS can now correctly handle text files (.BAT 
      or .BTM files, files to be LISTed or TYPEd, etc.) which have CR/LF, CR 
      only, or LF only at the end of each line. Previously not all of these line 
      terminators worked correctly.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Command Line Editing:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">You can now enter characters that would normally 
      be interpreted by the line editor as a command (e.g., Ctrl-D or Ctrl-K). 
      To do so precede the character with an ASCII 255 (hold down the ALT key 
      and enter 255 on the numeric keypad, then release the<br>
      ALT key). To enter the ASCII 255 itself into the line, you must enter it 
      twice.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The cursor shape will now be changed properly 
      when you hit the Ins key to switch editing modes. Previously if SETDOS 
      specified a block cursor in the default mode it would not be changed to an 
      underline when Ins was hit.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Aliases:</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Fixed a bug in alias expansion which occurred 
      when a &quot;%&quot; was the<br>
      last character on the line.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Batch Files:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">See the commands section below for information 
      on the new LOADBTM command, which allows any batch file to work as a BTM 
      file some or all of the time.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Batch files can now be nested 6 levels deep (the 
      previous limit was 4).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">I/O Redirection:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now checks for duplicate redirection (i.e., 
      &quot;DIR &gt; 1.DAT &gt; 2.DAT&quot;). Previously duplicate redirection could hang the 
      system.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The system will no longer hang if a command 
      specifies input redirection after output redirection.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Environment Variables:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">In order to support subtraction in the new %@EVAL 
      function (see below) 4DOS will no longer accept a &quot;-&quot; in the name of an 
      environment variable to be expanded, unless the name is enclosed in 
      brackets [].</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Three new internal variables have been added:</font><p>
      <font color="#0000CC" face="Courier New">%_dow The day of the week as a 
      string (Mon,Tue, etc.)<br>
      %_rows The height of the screen<br>
      %_columns The width of the screen</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">A new function, %@eval, has been added. The 
      syntax is:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;%@eval[expression]<br>
      <br>
      Where &quot;expression&quot; is any arithmetic expression. The expression can 
      include any of the following elements:  </font>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Courier New">parentheses, which may be nested<br>
    unary + or - operators<br>
    multiplication and division operators: *, /, and %% (modulo)<br>
    addition and subtraction operators: + and -<br>
    environment variables, variable functions, and constants</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Courier New">The elements of an expression are processed with the precedence shown above. 
    For example, 5*3+2 is treated as (5*3)+2 rather than 5*(3+2). Examples of 
    the use of %@eval are:<br>
    <br>
    Increment a variable: set a=%@eval[%a+1]<br>
    <br>
    Perform environment variable arithmetic:</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Courier New" color="#0000CC">set c=%@eval[(%a*2) + (%@len[%b]-5)*7]</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier New" color="#0000CC">
    <br>
    Evaluate expressions in IF:<br>
    <br>
    if %@eval[%@substr[%_time,0,2] %% 12] == 0 echo 12:00!<br>
    <br>
    Set up a simple command line calculator:<br>
    <br>
    alias calc `echo The answer is: %@eval[%&amp;]`</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC"><font face="Courier New">Another new function, %@INDEX[string1,string2] returns
    the position of string2 within string1 (string2 can be as small as a single 
      character). The first position in string1 is numbered 0. If there is no match, the function returns -1.</font></font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">When expanding environment variables 4DOS will display a
    &quot;Variable loop&quot; error if you nest variable functions too deep, or
    define variables which refer back to themselves.</font></li>
      </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Technical Information:</font><ul>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS.COM now closes file handles 5 - 29 when it starts. This
    should solve problems with programs that pass open file handles
    to a secondary shell.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now generates two different INT 2F calls to allow TSRs to
    tell when 4DOS is back at the prompt. These calls have AX =
    D44Eh. The first occurs immediately before displaying the
    prompt, with BX = 0; the second occurs after displaying the
    prompt and immediately before accepting keyboard input, with BX =
    1. Any routine intercepting these calls should preserve at least
    the SI, DI, BP, SP, DS, ES, and SS registers.</font></li>
        </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Commands</font><ul>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">ALIAS: ALIAS /R can now read multiple files, for example:<br>
    <br>
    alias /r alias1 alias2 alias3</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">CD and CDD: Modified to allow forward slashes (/) in
    path names.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">COPY: There are several changes:<br>
    <br>
    Problems with appending files in binary mode have been fixed.<br>
    <br>
          The way that COPY accesses files has been modified to minimize or eliminate problems with the MS-DOS APPEND command.<br>
    <br>
    The /R and /U switches are now ignored if the target is a
    device.<br>
    <br>
    A ^Z (end of file mark) is now properly added to the target
    file when it is in ASCII mode.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">DEL: Speed has been improved somewhat, especially on<br>
    non-cached disks.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">DESCRIBE: 4DOS description files will no longer get mixed up<br>
    between directories when running reasonably-behaved data pathing<br>
    utilities like DPATH.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">DIR: Changed to display directory totals even when the &quot;File not<br>
    found&quot; message is displayed. Changed the /F and /H switches so<br>
    they don't conflict with each other.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">DRAWBOX: Styles 3 and 4 now work properly.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">FOR: Now aborts when a nested batch file CANCELs. Also, fixed a<br>
    bug that was causing FOR variables to be ignored inside double<br>
    quotes.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">GLOBAL: Added a /Q(uiet) switch to disable the display<br>
    of &quot;GLOBAL: pathname&quot;.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">GOTO inside an IFF statement now cancels all IFF parsing,and assumes you've branched completely outside the IFF construct.
    If you haven't, you will get &quot;Unknown command&quot; errors on subsequent ELSE, ELSEIFF, and ENDIFF statements (see examples below).
    Also fixed a bug which prevented GOTO from branching to the end
    of the file from within a GOSUB subroutine.<br>
    <br>
          <i>iff &quot;%1&quot;==&quot;Y&quot;<br>
    :test<br>
    copy file1 a:<br>
    goto done &lt;--- Legal - branches outside the<br>
    else IFF block<br>
    copy file2 b:<br>
    goto test &lt;--- Illegal - branches within IFF<br>
    endiff block<br>
    [do some other work here]<br>
    :done</i></font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">HELP: There are several changes to HELP:<br>
    <br>
          There are many corrections and additions to the text, including a complete ASCII table.<br>
    <br>
          A new &quot;soft pagination&quot; capability enables many commands to
    be displayed completely on one screen if using more than 25
    lines, but paginates in a logical spot if using a 25-line
    screen.<br>
    <br>
          HELP is now DESQView-aware and should run properly in a
    less than full screen DESQView window.<br>
    <br>
          HELP now accepts up to 16 pages per topic and 32 crossreferences per topic, to allow 4MAKE users to install longer
    topics inside the help file.<br>
    <br>
          Three new environment variables have been added to give you
    better control over HELP:<br>
    <br>
    4HELP Specifies the full path and file name for the
    help program to be loaded when F1 is pressed.
    If not used, 4DOS will look for HELP.EXE in
    the current directory and then on the PATH.
    4HELP affects only F1, NOT the HELP command;
    if you need to change how the HELP command
    works as well, use an alias (see example
    below).<br>
    <br>
    4HELPF Specifies the full path and file name for the
    help text file. If not used, HELP will
    search for DOS.HLP in the directory specified
    in 4HELP (if any), then in the current directory and on the path.<br>
    <br>
    4HELPC Specifies control switches for HELP.EXE. At
    present the only switch is /R, which disables
    dynamic window resizing and forces all text
    screens to be displayed at the full screen
    height.<br>
    <br>
    For example, the following commands load HELP.EXE (which has
    been renamed to 4DHELP.EXE) from directory D:\4DOS when F1 is
    pressed, set up an alias to load this same program when the
    HELP command is used, load the help text file from RAMdisk
    drive I:\, and disable dynamic window resizing:<br>
    <br>
          <i>set 4help=d:\4dos\4dhelp.exe<br>
    <br>
    alias help d:\4dos\4dhelp.exe<br>
    rem The above could also use &quot;alias help %[4help]&quot;<br>
    set 4helpf=i:\dos.hlp<br>
    set 4helpc=/r</i></font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">IF: There are several corrections to the description
    in the manual. Some of these errors are present only in early
    copies of the manual:<br>
    <br>
          The DOS memory size option is named DOSMEM, not DOSFREE.<br>
    <br>
          The tests which check a numeric value (EMS, DOSMEM, etc.)
    use the same relational operators as the string tests, as
    shown in the examples. For example, the syntax for EMS
    should read:<br>
    <br>
    EMS relop n[K|M]<br>
    <br>
    where &quot;relop&quot; means EQ, GE, GT, etc. The &quot;relop&quot; is optional
    for ERRORLEVEL, but required for all other numeric tests.<br>
    <br>
          The MONITOR and VIDEO tests also require a relational operator (==, EQ, or NE) as described above for numeric tests.<br>
    <br>
          The IF ATTRIB test has an additional option: &quot;N&quot; tests for
    no attributes set (i.e. all of the other attributes are off). <br>
    <br>
          IF ATTRIB volname V will only work if the volume name refers to the root directory, and if there is a period after
    the eighth character in volume names of nine characters or
    more (e.g. to test for volume &quot;MYFILES0107&quot; in drive A:, use<br>
    IF ATTRIB A:\MYFILES0.107 V ...).<br>
    <br>
    * Two tests are missing from some copies of the manual:<br>
    <br>
    IF DISKFREE relop n<br>
    Tests the disk free space on the current drive. <br>
    Cannot be used to test other drives.<br>
    <br>
    IF FILESIZE filename relop n<br>
    Tests the size of the specified file.<br>
    <br>
    For example:<br>
    <br>
          <i>if diskfree gt 40M echo Plenty of room<br>
    if filesize myfile.dat gt 360K echo It won't fit!</i></font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">IF: String comparisons will now be done numerically
    if both values being compared begin with a digit. This allows
    you to do true arithmetic tests. For example:<br>
    <br>
          <i>set aa=027<br>
    set bb=20<br>
    if %aa gt %bb ... This test will succeed because it
    will compare the numeric values 27
    and 20.<br>
    if &quot;%aa&quot; gt &quot;%bb&quot; ... This test will fail because it will
    compare the alphanumeric values
    &quot;027&quot; and &quot;20&quot;, and the &quot;02&quot; will
    appear 'smaller' (alphanumerically)
    than &quot;20&quot;.</i></font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">IF: The ATTRIB test for a volume label has been changed to get
    around a bug in DOS, and should now recognize labels correctly.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">IFF: ELSE and ENDIFF will now be recognized properly even if
    they are not followed with whitespace.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">INPUT: Fixed a bug with very long variable names and/or input
    text.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">KEYSTACK: There are two changes:<br>
    <br>
          KEYSTACK now supports a new symbol, !, to clear keystrokes
    from the typeahead buffer, as well as anything in the
    KEYSTACK buffer. For example:<br>
    <br>
          <i>keystack ! @59</i><br>
    <br>
    will clear the typeahead buffer before stacking the @59 (F1)<br>
    keystroke.<br>
    <br>
          Some programs will not interpret stacked keystrokes properly unless they contain both the correct ASCII value and the
    correct keyboard &quot;scan code&quot;. For example, if you attempt to
    KEYSTACK an &quot;Enter&quot; using ASCII code 13 (carriage return) and
    see a small musical note instead, the program you are running probably needs 
          the scan code to interpret the keystroke properly.<br>
    <br>
    KEYSTACK now supports the entry of scan codes for standard
    ASCII keys. To enter the scan code, multiply it by 256 and
    add it to the ASCII code. Using the same example, the scan
    code for the Enter key is 28, so the full value for this key
    would be 28*256+13 = 7181. With some programs you will find
    that KEYSTACK 7181 works when KEYSTACK 13 does not (or vice
    versa). Experimentation is required to get the correct value. A full discussion and table of scan codes is beyond the
    scope of this document, but is available in many basic PC
    books.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">LIST: There are several changes:<br>
    <br>
          Changed the search and print keys to use letters instead of
    function keys: F(ind), N(ext), and P(rint). This avoids
    conflicts when you wish to redefine the function keys for
    other purposes.<br>
    <br>
    Added a new switch, /H, to strip the high bit of each character, for displaying WordStar documents and other similar
    files.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">LOADBTM: This is a new command. It will switch the
    current batch file to and from .BTM mode. The syntax is:<br>
    <br>
    LOADBTM [ON | OFF]<br>
    <br>
    LOADBTM ON loads the entire file into memory and processes the
    following lines as a .BTM file. LOADBTM OFF unloads the file
    from memory and processes the following lines one by one like a
    .BAT file. Both commands can be used regardless of the file's
    original extension. <br>
    <br>
    LOADBTM will allow you to have a single batch file for both
    COMMAND.COM and 4DOS, and select .BTM mode via a statement like:<br>
    <br>
          <i>if &quot;%@eval[2+2]&quot; == &quot;4&quot; loadbtm on</i><br>
    <br>
    Since the %@eval function does not exist under COMMAND.COM, the
    IF test will fail there and the rest of the line will be ignored.
    Under 4DOS where %@eval exists, the LOADBTM ON will be executed.<br>
    <br>
    LOADBTM will also allow you to load TSRs from a .BTM file by
    switching it into .BAT mode, loading the TSRs, and switching back
    to .BTM mode. However note that, depending on what the file
    does, such mode switching can erase much of the speed gained by
    using a .BTM file in the first place.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">LOG: Fixed a problem which caused a ^C to occasionally hang the
    system when LOG was ON. Also changed LOG to automatically switch
    LOG OFF if it couldn't open the log file.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">MOVE: Now returns an &quot;Access denied&quot; error 
          if you try to move files to a character device. Also the way that MOVE accesses
    files has been modified to minimize or eliminate problems with
    the MS-DOS APPEND command.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">REM: Will now be echoed if ECHO is ON.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">SET: SET /R can now read multiple files, for example:<br>
    <br>
    set /r env1 env2 env3</font></li>
          <li><font color="#0000CC">SETDOS: There are two changes:<br>
    <br>
    /S now resets the cursor shape immediately, so it can be used
    to hide the cursor while in a batch file.<br>
    <br>
    /U1 should now properly return uppercase filenames in all
    instances.</font></li>

      <li><font color="#0000CC">When starting a shareware copy of 4DOS there is 
      a 1/2-second, two-tone beep to identify this as a shareware copy, followed 
      by a 3-second delay to allow reading of the shareware reminder message. 
      Beginning with version 3.02, you can skip this<br>
      delay by pressing any key.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Features and Usage:</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Several changes have been made in 4DOS's file 
      handling to eliminate problems with incomplete redirected output files on 
      Novell networks.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">There is a small speedup in description 
      processing for the file commands (COPY, DEL, MOVE, and REN).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The &quot;?&quot; character in filename wildcards now 
      matches zero or more characters like COMMAND.COM instead of one or more 
      like previous versions of 4DOS. Thus &quot;DIR A?.&quot; will match both the files 
      &quot;A&quot; and &quot;AA&quot;; before it would only match &quot;AA&quot;. This change adjusts 4DOS to 
      work the way COMMAND.COM works instead of the way COMMAND.COM is 
      documented to work.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The F3 key now works like COMMAND.COM, so you 
      can type part of a line and hit F3 to get the rest of the previous line.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Aliases</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The ECHO state is now inherited properly when 
      batch files chain. In version 3.01 the echo state was inherited properly 
      on a CALL, but not on a chain.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Environment Variables</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">One new internal variable has been added:<br>
      <br>
      %_ndp Returns:<br>
      0 if no coprocessor is installed<br>
      87 for an 8087<br>
      287 for an 80287<br>
      387 for an 80387<br>
      <br>
      There are a few minor errors or points which are not clear in the list of 
      variable functions in some versions of the manual:<br>
      <br>
      When using variable functions they must be preceded (and optionally 
      followed) by a percent sign, like all other environment variables. For 
      example the &quot;ext&quot; function is referenced as %@ext[filename] or as %@ext[filename]%.<br>
      <br>
      The correct spelling for the string length function is &quot;%@len&quot;, not 
      &quot;%@length&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      The %@line function is missing from early copies of the manual. This 
      function returns the nth line of a file. The first line of the file is 
      numbered 0.<br>
      <br>
      In the %@substr function, the first character is numbered 0, and the 
      correct syntax is &quot;%@substr[string,start,length]&quot; not &quot;%@substr[string,start,end]&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Commas will now be ignored by %@eval. This will 
      allow (for example) %@eval[10,000 * 3] to get the expected result. It will 
      also allow %@eval to work on the output of a command like FREE, which 
      contains embedded commas. Also %@eval will give a &quot;Divide by zero&quot; error 
      message if you try to use 0 as a denominator for division or modulo 
      calculation; previously it would give an error for the modulo, but return 
      the numerator as the result for the division.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">%@substr can now handle quotes around the 
      &quot;string&quot; argument. Double quotes and back quotes are equivalent in this 
      context, and the quote characters DO count when determining which 
      characters are placed in the substring. This capability allows you to get 
      substrings of strings which contain commas. For example:<br>
      <br>
      %@substr[&quot;Mon, Aug 27, 1990&quot;, 1, 3]<br>
      <br>
      will return &quot;Mon&quot;. Previously the commas would be seen as argument 
      separators, even if they were within a quoted string.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">&nbsp;3.02 [p 42] Two new variable functions 
      have been added:<br>
      <br>
      %@upper[string] Returns the string converted to upper case.<br>
      <br>
      %@lower[string] Returns the string converted to lower case.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Both 4DOS.COM and the 4DOS EXE files now check 
      for version mismatch (e.g. trying to use version 3.01a 4DOS.COM with a 
      version 3.02 EXE file). Previously this testing was done by 4DOS.COM only, 
      so a mismatch could go undetected in some circumstances.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Divide by zero handling has been removed from 
      4DOS, allowing standard DOS divide by zero handling to take place. The 
      4DOS divide by zero handler was not providing any advantage and could 
      occasionally fail to recover properly from division errors in<br>
      application programs.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Cursor positioning during command line editing 
      will now take place in the current video page, rather than assuming page 
      0. This should fix minor cursor positioning problems with programs that 
      shell to DOS with the video adapter set somewhere other than page 0 (like 
      Turbo Debugger).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Handling of the Abort response to a critical 
      error during a 4DOS command has been modified to solve some obscure 
      problems with changing floppy disks after Aborting from a disk error.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Commands</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DESCRIBE: Problems with missing &lt;cr&gt;s in 
      description files have been solved. These problems did not cause any 
      trouble within 4DOS, but 3rd-party description editors were confused by 
      them.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DIR: The time separator character will now be 
      correct when the country code is set for outside the US. Previously it was 
      hardcoded as a colon.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#0000CC">Problems with occasional &quot;Out of memory&quot; errors 
      and missing description displays in DIR have been resolved. However, if 
      you fragment DOS memory (for example by loading two TSRs, then unloading 
      the first but not the second) you can get &quot;Out of memory&quot; errors in larger 
      directories as DIR tries to expand the memory it is using to store your 
      filenames and descriptions. If this occurs, determine the cause of the 
      fragmentation and resolve it. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">IF and IFF: The string tests will now work 
      correctly even if the string contains an &quot;=&quot; sign (which is one of the IF 
      test characters) or a &quot;/&quot; (which is the 4DOS switch character). Also the 
      EMS test now returns the correct value (0) if there is no EMS driver 
      present. In version 3.01 it would return a random value.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">LIST: The switches now work properly when 
      specified without spaces, eg as /WS or /W/S. Previously they required a 
      space (/W /S) to work correctly.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">SETDOS: The COMPOUND character (SETDOS /C) can 
      now be any ASCII character except those specified in the manual as not 
      allowed. Previously characters above ASCII 127 would not work as the 
      separator.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#0000CC">Help System</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">The text has been modified in many places. An 
      ANSI table has´been added along with the APPEND, FASTOPEN, GRAPHICS, KEYB, 
      NLSFUNC, RECOVER, and REPLACE commands, and more information on HELP 
      itself. The explanations of JOIN and SUBST are more detailed. All resident 
      commands now show their DOS 3.3 resident size. Several minor typographical 
      errors have been corrected.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">HELP has two switches which can be set 
      temporarily on the command line (in version 3.02), or &quot;permanently&quot; -- 
      until explicitly changed -- via the 4HELPC environment variable (see 
      below). When switches are set on the command line they can be placed 
      before or after the topic name (if any), so for example these two commands 
      are equivalent:<br>
      <br>
      <i>help copy /r<br>
      help /r copy<br>
      <br>
      </i>The switches are:</font></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font color="#0000CC" face="Courier New">/BW: Forces HELP to display 
      all text in monochrome colors, to support the use of monochrome monitors 
      attached to color video boards (e.g. use of a composite monochrome monitor 
      on a CGA system). If you have such a system you will probably want to set 
      the /BW switch permanently as shown under 4HELPC below.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000CC"><font face="Courier New">/R: Disables dynamic 
      window resizing and forces all text screens to be displayed at the full 
      screen height for those who prefer an unchanging display window size.</font></font></p>

    Enhancements:</font><ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS will now preserve leading whitespace on the 
      command tail for external commands, and pass no whitespace to the command 
      if that's how the line is entered. For example, the command:<br>
      <br>
      <i>myprog/c</i><br>
      <br>
      will pass &quot;/c&quot; to MYPROG; previously an extra space (&quot; /c&quot;) was passed. 
      This should fix occasional problems with programs that can't handle 
      leading whitespace.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">There is one additional character which can be 
      used after the 4DOS escape character (the escape character is normally 
      ctrl-X): a &quot;t&quot; will mean the ASCII TAB character, so that:<br>
      <br>
      ^Xt<br>
      <br>
      will place a TAB on the line (^X means the single character ctrl-X, which 
      appears on your screen as an upward-pointing arrow).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000CC">Command Line Editing:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">TAB has been added as a synonym for F9, and 
      Shift-TAB as a synonym for F8. Also the F3 key will now put the cursor at 
      the end of the command line after recalling the previous command.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000CC">Batch Files:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Error levels generated by external programs in 
      batch files are now returned properly to the calling program when the 
      batch file is run from a transient 4DOS shell (4DOS /C). This should fix 
      problems with BBS systems which return error levels through batch files 
      (also see the EXIT command below for related information).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000CC">Technical Information:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">4DOS now does a disk reset following a ^C, or a

    </ul>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#0000CC">Commands:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">BEEP, DELAY: Fixed a bug that could hang the 
      system if a BEEP or DELAY was active at an even 1/2 hour.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DATE: If you enter only two digits for the year 
      and it is below 80, 4DOS will now assume it is in the 21st century; if it 
      is 80 or above 4DOS will assume it is in the 20th century. You can specify 
      the year you want explicitly by using a 4-digit value.&nbsp; The system of 
      using 3-digit year values for dates in the 21st century, as documented in 
      the printed manual, has been removed. Also DATE now supports the European 
      date display format (Mon 1.Jan 1991).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">DIR: Fixed an occasional problem with doing a 
      &quot;DIR .&quot; in the root directory.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">EXIT: EXIT now accepts a numeric argument (EXIT 
      n). The argument value is returned to the previous program as the error 
      level. If no argument is given the error level from the most recent 
      external program will be returned; this is a change from previous versions 
      of 4DOS, for compatibility with COMMAND.COM.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">FOR: An active FOR is now aborted properly when 
      a nested batch file CANCELs, or when a batch file chains to another batch 
      file.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">GOSUB: Previously if a GOSUB was used within an 
      IFF statement and there was another IFF statement inside the called 
      subroutine, the two IFF statements could interfere with each other. This 
      has been corrected; two such IFF statements will now operate independently 
      of each other. This also means that you can use a GOTO inside the 
      subroutine without canceling the operation of the IFF statement in the 
      calling part of the batch file (see next item on GOTO and IFF).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">PROMPT: When displaying the date in the prompt 
      4DOS now supports the European format (e.g. Mon 1. Jan 1991).</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">REN: Fixed a bug which would give an &quot;Invalid 
      path&quot; error when the only thing specified for the target was &quot;.&quot;, as in:<br>
      <br>
      <i>ren \4dos\4dos.doc .</i></font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">TIME: An invalid entry will now display an error 
      message and prompt again, instead of generating an incorrect time value.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">TYPE: TYPE will now stop on a ^Z (end of file 
      mark), for compatibility with COMMAND.COM.</font></li>
      <li><font color="#0000CC">Y: &quot;Y:&quot; at the start of the command line will 
      now refer to drive Y rather than the Y command. This should allow network 
      users with mapped &quot;Y&quot; drives to execute programs on those drives without 
      having to disable the 4DOS Y command.</font></li>
