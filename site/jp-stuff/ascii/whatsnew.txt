NEW VERSION OVERVIEW -  Take Command and 4NT 8.0
------------------------------------------------ 

Since the last major release we've added over 200 new features,
commands, switches, variables, and other enhancements to 4NT and
Take Command! 

This is a summary of the compatibility fixes and new features.  For 
complete details, see the appropriate topics in the online help. 


FEATURE LIST:
-------------

    The window menus are now in the language dll's, so they will be
      localized for English, German, and French.
      
    You can now specify regular expressions for file name tests.  
      The syntax is:
      
        ::regex
	
      For example:
     
        dir ::ca[td]
      
    Changed the startup inheritance so that 4NT / TC will only inherit
      .INI values from a prior 4NT / TC shell if they're a child pipe 
      process or were started from a parent 4NT / TC process.  (This 
      also means the %_shell internal variable has changed; see below.)

    Directory Aliases - are a shorthand way of specifying drive / 
      pathnames.  For example, if you define an alias:

        alias pf:=c:\program files

      Then you can reference the files in "c:\program files\jpsoft" by
      entering "pf:\jpsoft".  Directory aliases work in places that 
      accept filenames and directory names, including filename 
      completion.

    FTP / IFTP - added internal support for additional FTP LIST formats.
      The parser should now be able to recognize these formats:

        EPLF
        WFTPD
        VMS (single-line filenames only)
        NetPresenz (Macintosh)
        NetWare
        All known UNIX and Linux formats
        Windows FTP server

    FTP - now supports FTP / FTPS accounts where you do not have
      access to the root (i.e., logon puts you into a subdirectory).
      (IFTP already supported this.)  Unfortunately, this also means
      that FTP access (not IFTP) is slightly slower.
      
    FTP / IFTP - added support for symbolic hostnames (i.e., in
      "\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"), and using symbolic
      names and port numbers with no username / password.
      
    If you press Ctrl-C in Take Command, it now checks to see if it is
      at the prompt (where a "Copy" would be valid); if it is not, a 
      Ctrl-C will act like a Ctrl-Break.

    Added an additional parameter type for alias argument expansion:

      %-n$ - substitute all of the arguments from 1 to n-1.

    Added an additional parameter type for batch variable expansion:

      %-n$ - substitute all of the arguments from 1 to n-1.

    Added an additional parameter type for user-defined function 
      argument expansion:

      %-n$ - substitute all of the arguments from 1 to n-1.

    Added support for stream completion (i.e., "test:t<tab>").  Note
      that you cannot attempt to complete both a filename and a stream
      name at the same time (i.e., "t*:t<tab>" will NOT work!).

    Added regular expression searches of file descriptions.  The syntax
      is:

      /R"text"

      The regular expression searches also support exclusions
      (/!R"text").

    Added ! (exclusion) for /I (description) searches.  The syntax is:

      /!I"text"

    Added ! (exclusion) for /[D..] (date) ranges.  The syntax is:

      /![D...]

      For example, to exclude all of today's files:

        /![D]

    Added ! (exclusion) for /[S..] (size) ranges.  The syntax is:

      /![Sn]

      For example, to exclude all files that are >= 100 bytes:

        /![S100]

    Added ! (exclusion) for /[T..] (time) ranges.  The syntax is:

      /![T...]

    File exclusion ranges now allow directories to be excluded.  For
      example:

      dir /s /[!foo\] *  - exclude any subdirectories named "foo" 
        anywhere in the directory tree.

    When at the command prompt (i.e., not executing a batch file) the
      parser will look for the following aliases:

        PRE_INPUT - executed immediately before accepting input for a
	  new command line.
	  
        PRE_EXEC - executed immediately after a command line is entered
	  (before any expansion or redirection).
	  
        POST_EXEC - executed immediately after returning from a
	  command and before displaying the prompt.
	  
      None of these aliases will be passed any arguments.
      
    Plugins can now define functions that will receive every keystroke
      entered at the command prompt.  A keystroke plugin can call
      other functions or even change the keystroke before passing it
      back to 4NT / TC.
	  

Startup Options
---------------

    There is a new startup switch for 4NT and Take Command:

      /H - start 4NT or TC as a hidden window.  Note that in 4NT you 
             will still see the console window momentarily appear and
	     then disappear (Windows limitation).  With TC, you will 
	     not see any window appear. The 4NT / TC window will not 
	     appear on the start bar, or in the Alt-Tab list of 
	     applications -- if you need to kill it you'll have to 
	     use the Windows Task Manager.


Command Line Editing:
---------------------

    Added Shift-Ins as an alternative to ^V (paste from clipboard).

    Filename completion now checks whether the filename is inside a
      variable function, so you no longer need to add a space following
      the left bracket (i.e., "%@name[a<tab>]" instead of 
      "%@name[ a<tab>]".)


New .INI directives:
--------------------

    AutoCancel=NO|yes - if set to YES, a ^C will cancel a batch file 
      without any prompting.

    AutoRun=YES|no - if set to NO, 4NT / TC will not execute any
      applications in the "Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\Autorun"
      registry keys in HKLM or HKCU.
      
    BGColorRGB=n,n,n (TCMD only) - set the default background color
      as an RGB value.
      
    FGColorRGB=n,n,n (TCMD only) - set the default foreground color
      as an RGB value.
      
    InactiveTransparency=nnn (TCMD only) - set the transparency level
      of the TCMD window when it is out of focus (range is 40-255).

    ListInverseColors=fg on bg (4NT only) - set the color to use in
      LIST when showing search matches.

    LogAll (TCMD only) - log all output (see LOG below).
    

Modified .INI directives:
-------------------------

    ColorDir - now supports and/or/xor tests for the attributes (see 
      DIR).

    Editor - now supported in 4NT.  Editor also now supports variables
      and aliases in the Editor argument. (Note that this means if you
      have been specifying a LFN with embedded whitespace, you will now
      need to quote the program name.)

    WindowState - added new option "Hidden" to hide the command 
      processor window at startup.  (See "Startup Options" above.)

  
New Internal Variables:
-----------------------

    %_CDROMS - returns a space-delimited list of the CD-ROM drives.

    %_DVDS - returns a space-delimited list of the DVD drives.

    %_EDITMODE - returns 0 if in overstrike mode, or 1 if in insert
      mode.

    %_EXECSTR - returns the return code of the last @EXECSTR function.

    %_EXPANSION - returns the current expansion mode (SETDOS /X).

    %_HDRIVES - returns a space-delimited list of the hard drives.

    %_READY - like %_DRIVES, but returns a space-delimited list of the
      drives that are ready.

    %_REGISTERED - returns the registered name or an empty string if
      4NT / TC isn't registered.

    %_SHELLS - returns the same value that %_SHELL did in previous 
      versions (see below).
      
    %_VIRTUALPC - returns 1 if 4NT / TC is running inside VirtualPC.

    %_VMWARE - returns 1 if 4NT / TC is running inside VMWare.

    %_WOW64 - returns 1 if 4NT / TC is running in the WOW64 environment.

    
Modified Internal Variables:
----------------------------

    %_shell - will always now return 0 unless 4NT / TC was
      started by another 4NT / TC process (either directly or via
      a pipe.)  This now matches the %_shell with the documentation; if
      you have need of the old %_shell behavior you can use %_shells.


New Variable Functions:
-----------------------

    %@CAPI - like @WINAPI, but for _cdecl functions.  The syntax is:

      @CAPI[module,function[,integer | NULL | BUFFER | |PINT=n | PLONG=n
          | PDWORD=n "string"]
        module - name of the DLL containing the function
        function - function name (case sensitive)
        integer - an integer value to pass to the function
        NULL - a null pointer (0)
        BUFFER - @CAPI will pass an address for an internal buffer 
                   for the API to return a Unicode string value.
        aBUFFER - @CAPI will pass an address for an internal buffer 
                   for the API to return an ASCII string value.
        "string" - text argument
        PINT=n - pointer to an integer
        PLONG=n - pointer to a long
        PDWORD=n - pointer to a DWORD

    %@DRIVETYPEEX[drive] : Return the type for the specified drive:

      0 The drive type cannot be determined 
      1 The root path is invalid (no volume is mounted at the path) 
      2 Removable disk  
      3 Fixed disk  
      4 Remote (network) drive 
      5 CD-ROM 
      6 RAM disk
      7 DVD
      8 Tape

    %@OWNER - returns the owner of the specified file (if any).

    %@SCRIPT - execute a line in the specified Active Scripting engine.
      The syntax is:
      
        %@script[engine,command]
	
      For example, to execute the command "MsgBox" in VBSCRIPT:
      
        %@script[vbscript,MsgBox "Called MsgBox from 4NT"]
	
      (You can find the names of the installed engines by running
      the SCRIPT command (see below) with no arguments.)
	
    %@UNQUOTES - removes leading & trailing double quotes.

    %@WINPOS - returns normal position of the window with the
      specified title in the format "top,left,bottom,right".

    %@WMI - query Windows Management Interface.  This function is *very*
      powerful, letting you query nearly any Windows value.  The syntax
      is:

	%@WMI[namespace,"wql search string"[,enum]]

      
      You can omit the "enum" parameter if you're querying a single
      property and instance.  For example:
      
        %@wmi[root\cimv2,"SELECT name FROM Win32_Processor"]
	
      The optional "enum" parameter specifies the property instance to
        return (for classes that return multiple properties).

	echo %@wmi[root\cimv2,"SELECT name, state FROM Win32_service",4]

      For more details on what is available, see the WMI and WQL 
      documentation on MSDN (msdn.microsoft.com), and download the 
      "WMI Code Creator" from Microsoft and browse the available 
      namespaces, classes, and properties.  Also see the new WMIQUERY
      internal command (below).

    %@XMLPATH - return the text of the current element.  The syntax is:
    
      %@XMLPATH[filename,path]
      
        filename - name of XML file
	path - one or more element accessors separated by a /.
	

Modified Variable Functions:
----------------------------

    %@EVAL - if a "=X" is appended to the expression, the output will
      be in hex with a leading "0x".

    %@FIELD - added ranges (see @WORD for details).

    %@TRUENAME - added support for junctions.

    %@WINAPI - added new argument types to pass pointers to integers,
      longs, and dwords:

	PINT=n
	PLONG=n
	PDWORD=n

    %@WORD - added ranges.  The syntax is:

      %@WORD[start[-end|+range],string]

      You can specify an inclusive range with a '-'.  For example:

        %@WORD[2-4,A B C D E F G]  will return "C D E".  (Note that you
	cannot use inclusive ranges when starting from the end.)

      You can specify a relative range with a '+'.  For example:

        %@WORD[2+1,A B C D E F G]  will return "C D".


New Internal Commands:
----------------------

    OSD - (On Screen Display) Writes "floating" text to the display
      (like TV or monitor prompts).  OSD has several options:

	/Font=n         Font height (default 18)
	/N		Don't wait for timeout
	/POS=top,left   Screen coordinates for the top left corner of
	                  the text (default 10,10)
        /RGB=r,g,b      Text color in RGB format (0-255) (default 0,255,0)
        /TIME=n         Time to display the text in seconds (default 10)
	/TOP            Position the text to the top of the display
	/BOTTOM	        Position the text at the bottom of the display
        /LEFT           Position the text at the left of the display
	/RIGHT          Position the text at the right of the display
	/HCENTER        Center the text horizontally
	/VCENTER        Center the text vertically
	
      You can combine the window positioning options. 
	
    PRIORITY - display or set process priority, or suspend / resume
      process. The syntax is:

      PRIORITY [/Q /R /S PID | "title" ABOVE | BELOW | NORMAL | HIGH | IDLE | REALTIME]

        /Q - quiet (don't display resume/suspend messages)
        /R - resume process
        /S - suspend process
        PID - process ID
        title - main window title
        ABOVE - above normal priority
        BELOW - below normal priority
        NORMAL - normal priority
        HIGH - high priority
        IDLE - idle priority (runs only when system is idle)
        REALTIME - realtime priority

      You can specify the process either by the PID or by the window 
      title.  If you do not enter any arguments, PRIORITY displays the
      processes, their current priority, and the module names.  If you
      don't enter a window title or PID, PRIORITY will set the priority
      of the current process.

    SCRIPT - execute scripts using Active Scripting engines (i.e., 
      VBScript, JavaScript, PerlScript, etc.)  The syntax is:
      
        SCRIPT [/E engine] [filename ...]
	
          /E - specify the scripting engine to use (if SCRIPT can't
	         determine it from the extension).
		 
      If you don't specify any arguments, SCRIPT will display the names
      of the installed active scripting engines.
      
    SNMP - send SNMP traps.  The syntax is:
    
      SNMP remotehost trapOID "value" [username password]
      
        remotehost
        trapOID - the full OID of the trap
	value - descriptive text
	username - username for SNMPv3 trap
	password - password for SNMPv3 trap
      
      SNMP normall sends an SNMPv2 Trap; if you specify a username and
        password it will send an SNMPv3 Trap.
	
      The following symbolic names are recognized and translated:
      
        Trap Name              OID
	---------              ---
        coldStart              1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1
        warmStart              1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.2
        linkDown               1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3
        linkUp                 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4
        authenticationFailure  1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.5 
        egpNeighborLoss        1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.6
        enterpriseSpecific     1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.7
	
    SYNC - synchronize two directories.  The syntax is:

      SYNC [/D /E /G /H /I"description] /K /N /P /Q /S[n] /V /W /X /Z] source target

        /W - delete files in the target directory that are not present 
	  in the source directory.

        (The other SYNC options are the same as for COPY.)

    WMIQUERY - Query the Windows WMI interface.  The syntax is:
    
      WMIQUERY [/A /B /C /H] namespace "query string" [index]
      
        /A - display all class instances starting at "index"
        /B - separate class instances with a blank line
	/C - display matching classes for the specified namespace
	       ("query string" is filter)
        /H - display a header for class instances
	namespace - a . defaults to root\cimv2
	"query string" - WMI 
	index - instance of the class to display	
      
        wmiquery . "SELECT name FROM Win32_Processor"]
	
      For more details on what is available, see the WMI and WQL 
      documentation on MSDN (msdn.microsoft.com), and download the 
      "WMI Code Creator" from Microsoft and browse the available 
      namespaces, classes, and properties.
    

Modified Internal Commands:
---------------------------

    ACTIVATE - added some new options:

      /R(estore) - restore the original foreground window after 
        updating the specified window.

      TRAY - move the specified window to the system tray.  Note: this
        is intended for 4NT and Take Command; no other console apps
	will work (Windows limitation); and GUI apps will only work 
	if they have built-in tray support.

    ALIAS - now prevents a common user error when creating an @ and @@
      key alias with the same key.  (ALIAS will delete the previous 
      alias definition so you won't have both active.)

    COPY - added new options:

      /F - don't create empty subdirectories (must be used with /S).

    COPY - now supports connected web folders.  If an HTML file (i.e.,
      with an .htm or .html extension) is copied, COPY will look for a
      folder in the same directory with the same name and an extension 
      of ".files".  If it is found, the .files directory will be copied
      to the target directory. You can disable connected web folders by
      setting the registry key:

        HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\NoFileFolderConnection=0

    COPY - added support for copying streams attached to directory 
      names.

    DEL - added support for deleting streams attached to directory names.
    
    DETACH - added the /Q(uiet) option to suppress displaying the 
      process ID.

    DIR - enhanced the /Q (show owner) option to display owners of 
      remote files and folders.

    DIR - enhanced the directory colorization.  You can now use and/or
      /xor combinations (like IFF) with the attribute tests.  (ColorDir 
      does not support parentheses for grouping; the processing is left 
      to right.)  For example:

        set colordir=com exe:bri red; rdonly .and. system:bri green

    DO - added new options:

      /C - each time through the loop, assign the next character in the
           expression to the argument; i.e.:

               do var in /c ABC
                   echo %var
               enddo

             will echo "A", "B", and "C".

      FOR n SECONDS | MINUTES | HOURS - loops for the specified amount
        of time.

    EVENTLOG - added a new option:
    
      /Cn - set the Category.  The value can be from 0-999999; Windows
            defines 0-7 as:
	      0 - None
	      1 - Devices
	      2 - Disk
	      3 - Printers
	      4 - Services
	      5 - Shell
	      6 - System
	      7 - Network
	      
    FFIND - added support for the /Sn syntax (to specify the maximum
      subdirectory recursion level).

    FFIND (4NT) - now supports the "Editor" .INI directive.

    FFIND - if you specify /U, FFIND will no longer print a CR/LF 
      before the summary (so that it can be parsed by @EXECSTR).

    FFIND - added new options:

      /G - change to the directory where the file was found.

    GLOBAL - added support for the /Sn syntax (to specify the maximum
      subdirectory recursion level).

    GOSUB - now allows calling subroutines in other files.  (This
      allows you to create files containing common subroutines.)
      The syntax is:
      
        GOSUB "filename" label [args]
	
    GOSUB - if you are in the batch debugger and attempt to call a
      nonexistent subroutine, GOSUB will now display a messagebox 
      before exiting the batch file.

    GOTO - if you are in the batch debugger and attempt to branch to a
      nonexistent label, GOTO will now display a messagebox before 
      exiting the batch file.

    HEAD - added support for displaying streams attached to directory 
      names.

    IF - added new tests:

	IF PLUGIN modulename ... - returns TRUE if the specified plugin
	  module is loaded.

    IFTP - added some additional options:

      /P0 - disable passive mode (overrides PassiveFTP directive)
      /P1 - enable passive mode (overrides PassiveFTP directive)

    KEYSTACK - added new options:

      /A - append to existing KEYSTACK string.  (I suspect this is 
        going to be useless, but I've had a continuing stream of 
	requests for it.  If you actually find a use for it, please
	let me know!)

      /R - read input from the specified file.

    LIST - if you are displaying input from a pipe, the 'E' (invoke 
      editor) key will copy the pipe contents to the clipboard and then
      open the editor.  (You will need to do the paste into the editor 
      manually.)

    LIST - has some additional options:

      (4NT) - added support for the 'E' (invoke editor) key (already 
                in TC).

      /C (4NT) - display the file in a separate screen buffer and 
                   restore the original buffer (& contents) upon 
		   exiting LIST.
 
      /N - display line numbers on each line.  You can also toggle line
            numbers with the 'L' key.

    LIST - added support for displaying streams attached to directory 
      names.


    LOG - added a new option:
    
      /A - (TCMD only) logs all output to the a log file (same name
           as the normal log but with a ".all" extension appended).
	   
    MKLNK - specifying /D for a filename with no additional links will
      no longer delete the file.

    MOVE - added the /N options:

	/NE - don't display errors
	/NT - don't update JPSTREE.IDX

    MOVE - now supports connected web folders.  If an HTML file (i.e., 
      with an .htm or .html extension) is moved, MOVE will look for a 
      folder in the same directory with the same name and an extension 
      of ".files".  If it is found, the .files directory will be moved 
      to the target directory. You can disable connected web folders by
      setting the registry key:

        HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\NoFileFolderConnection=0

    OPTION - the "Registration" tab has a new button to remove the 
      registration information from the computer.

             module (also supports wildcards)

      /P - pause after displaying a screen page

    PLUGIN - the /I(nfo) switch now supports wildcards, and also 
      displays the full pathname.

    REN - added the /N options:

	/NE - don't display errors
	/NT - don't update JPSTREE.IDX

    SETDOS - added option:

      /X9 - enable / disable include lists
      
    SHORTCUT - displaying a shortcut's values now shows the icon offset
      and the hotkey.
    
    SHORTCUT - you can now define the hotkey for the link:
    
      SHORTCUT "command" ["args" "dir" "description" "linkname" mode [iconfile iconoffset [hotkey]]]

      The hotkey is in the same format as KEYSTACK; i.e. "Ctrl-Alt-[Shift-]x"

    TAIL - added support for displaying streams attached to directory 
      names.

    TCTOOLBAR - you can now have up to 64 buttons.  There are also some
      new options:

        /C - clear toolbar

	/R filename - load toolbar buttons from the specified file.
	    (A /R will NOT clear an existing toolbar; you must use the
	    /C flag in conjunction with /R for that.)  The file is in 
	    the same format as the [Buttons] section in TCMD32.INI:

               Bn=flags,text,command
 
		  Bn - The button number (1 – 32) 
                  flags - 0=Echo, 1=Echo & Execute, 2=Execute w/o echo

      source file.

    TREE - added support for ranges (when used with /F).

    TRUENAME - added support for junctions.

    TYPE - added support for displaying streams attached to directory 
      names.


New Debugger Features:
----------------------

    Batch debugger options (in BATCH.BCP) can now be set in the 
      Debugger tab of the OPTION dialog.
      
    You can change the line to be executed next when in debugging mode
      with either the "GOTO" dialog or by moving the caret to the line
      and either right clicking & selecting "Jump to This Line" or by
      pressing Ctrl-Shift-F11.  Note that if you attempt to jump into
      or out of a DO loop or IFF block, bad things will happen!
      
    A ^C / ^Break while debugging will now bring up the prompt:

      Cancel batch job %s ? (Y/N/A/D) :

      Pressing 'D' will return you to single-step mode in the debugger.
      (This allows you to interrupt a "run-to-breakpoint" without 
      terminating the debugger.)

    Now supports saving Unicode files.

    Added support for Ctrl-F1 (help for highlighted word) to Take 
      Command.

    The Alias window now uses the same syntax coloring as the debugger
      window.

    Alt-F11 now invokes the Evaluate Expression dialog.

    Ctrl-F9 invokes the Evaluate Expression dialog for the current 
      line selection, or if there is no selection then for the current
      line in the debugger.

    When running to a breakpoint, the debugger will no longer revert to
      single-stepping following a call to a compressed .BTM.
      
    When running to a breakpoint, the debugger will highlight the line
      currently being executed.
       
    The Find and Replace dialogs are now non-modal.  Also if you
      ve selected something on the line, the search field will be
      pre-populated with the selection.

    Improved printer support.

    Added support for background colors for keywords, text blocks,
      delimiters and numbers.

    Added bracket and line highlighting.

    Added case-fixing. When turned on, this will automagically fix 
      keyword case.
