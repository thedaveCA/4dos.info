4NT 8.0 / Take Command 8.01

8.01, Build 64:
---------------

    Minor help file updates.

    Minor corrections to SDK TakeCmd.h file.

    Fixed a problem with the (not recommended) batch variable
      syntax when appending a + or - to a variable name followed
      by a number.  (This can cause confusion with the new variable
      range arguments; we recommend always using white space
      around the arguments.) 

    GOSUB - fix for a problem with GOSUB arguments when using 
      incorrect syntax for the label (inserting white space 
      after the ':').

    TAIL (4NT only) - fixed an erratic problem when displaying
      the start of Unicode files with some fonts.

    TOUCH - fixed a problem when creating a file (with /C) that
      begins with a @.  (This is STRONGLY discouraged, as a
      leading @ character is interpreted by 4NT / TC / CMD to
      mean at least two different things -- making it a part of
      the filename as well is guaranteed to cause you trouble!)

8.01, Build 63:
---------------

    Fixed a GPF in @FLOOR and @CEILING.

8.01, Build 62:
---------------

    Fixed a problem with dialogs and themes.

    Some minor help file updates.

8.01, Build 61:
---------------

    FFIND, LIST - fixed a hang caused by Windows incorrectly
      identifying a binary file as Unicode.

    HELP - fixed a GPF when requesting help for a nonexistent
      variable function.

8.01, Build 60:
---------------

    Fix for a problem with @MAX and @MIN when passing negative
      numbers.

Version 8.01, Build 59:
-----------------------

    The Spanish localization is now nearly complete, including
      all menus, dialogs, and internal messages and errors 
      (except for some of the usage error messages).

    Miscellaneous minor help updates.

    Fixed a problem with FTP directory parsing on WinCE FTP 
      servers.

    4NT - Fixed a problem with the 4NT window sometimes flashing
      at startup inside TCI.

    The IPWorks dll's have been updated.

    The attribute selection switch (/A:...) now includes 'L' (for
      junctions and symbolic links), for compatibility with Vista's
      CMD.EXE.  (It is synonymous with the existing 'J'.)

    Added support for the wacky CMD substring variables with the wacky 
      CMD delayed expansion syntax (i.e., "!var:~10,5!).

    @MAX and @MIN - now ignore leading & trailing commas.

    @SYMLINK - new variable function to return the target of the
      specified symbolic link.

    ATTRIB - added the -I and +I (not indexed) attribute.

    COPY - added support for the (undocumented) CMD.EXE kludge
      "copy file+" (to touch the date & time of the specified file
      to the current date/time.

    COPY (Vista only) - changed the /L (FTP ASCII) option to match
      Vista's CMD definition:

        /L - if the source is a symbolic link, copy the link to the
             target instead of the actual file.

    COPY - changed the /L (FTP ASCII) switch to /FTP:A (see above).

    COPY - added support for /F when copying from FTP.

    DIR (Vista only) - includes support for displaying symbolic links
      (SYMLINK for files, SYMLINKD for directories).  For one column
      displays, DIR will display the name followed by the target.

    LIST - fixed a problem with the 'E' (editor) option in pipes.

    MKLINK (Vista only, for compatibility with CMD) - create symbolic 
      links.  The syntax is:

      MKLINK [/D /H /J /Q] link target

       /D      Create a directory symbolic link.  (The default is to
                 create a file symbolic link.)
       /H      Create a hard link (like MKLNK).
       /J      Create a junction.
       /Q      Don't display results.
       Link    The new symbolic link name
       Target  The pathname (full or relative) that the new link 
                 refers to.

    OSD - fix for a Windows bug with repeated invocations.  Also
      added support for multiple simultaneous OSD windows.

    PDIR (Vista only) - includes support for displaying symbolic links
      (SYMLINK for files, SYMLINKD for directories).

    PDIR - the format for the size/"DIR" field has been increased to
      15 characters (because of the changes for SYMLINK and SYMLINKD).

    SETLOCAL / ENDLOCAL - added a check for nesting SETLOCALS with
      differing delayed expansion flags (not recommended!).

    TEE - the output files can now be read by other apps while the
      TEE is in process.


Build 50:
---------

    Miscellaneous minor help updates.

    JPSTREE.IDX - added a workaround for Vista.  Vista restricts the
      root directory access for non-admin users, so if you don't have
      TreePath defined in your .INI, the default directory for jpstree
      will be %appdata%.  If %appdata% isn't defined in your environment,
      the default will be the 4NT / TC installation directory.

    @FILEWRITE - changed to return the number of bytes written rather
      the number of bytes written + 1.

    @OWNER - added a workaround for a bug in active directory DFS.

    @REGEXSUB - added check for parenthesized arguments.

    @SELECT - fixed a problem when KEYSTACK'ing a long line to @SELECT
      (to set the text search string).

    DIR /Q - added a workaround for a bug in active directory DFS.

    GOSUB - added a kludge for (illegal) label names with trailing colons.

    LIST - added support for listing HTTP files.

    LIST - fixed a problem with /B and /L.

    PDIR /(M) - if the file cannot be accessed, the MD5 value returned
      will be "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF".

    PDIR /(R) - if the file cannot be accessed, the CRC32 value returned
      will be "FFFFFFFF".

    PDIR /Q - added a workaround for a bug in active directory DFS.

    PRIORITY - now returns an error rather than suspending / resuming
      the process if you don't specify either /R or /S and you don't
      have a priority argument.

    TASKLIST (Vista only) - no longer displays the "Not all privileges 
      referenced are assigned to the caller" when running as a limited
      user.  (Note that this only affects TASKLIST; a limited user will
      still get the error when attempting to run TASKEND.)
	  
Build 49:
---------

    BDEBUGGER - the watch window now checks for a variable
	  in the watch list being removed from the environment.
	  
    GLOBAL - added check for /S option only allowed before
	  the GLOBAL arguments.

Build 48:
---------

    Fixed a Windows bug when accessing an FTP server with 
	  Wow64FsRedirection=No (64-bit Windows only).
	  
	Fixed a problem in date ranges with ISO dates when no 
	  seconds are specified.
	  
Build 47:
---------

    @REGEX, @REGEXSUB, @REGEXINDEX - added kludge to look for 
      trailing ^" in regular expression, and not interpret it
      in the token parser as escaping the double quote.  This
      should allow you to use arguments such as:
	  
        %@regexindex["\^",%str]
	
	WOW64FsRedirection - fixed a problem with 4NT / TC not
	  immediately recognizing the directive if it was not in
	  the startup .INI file.
	  
Build 46:
---------

    UNSET - fix for the (mostly useless) "UNSET *" syntax.
	
Build 45:
---------

    Help file updates.
	
    Miscellaneous fixes for Vista bugs when reading / setting
	  environment variables.
	  
    BDEBUGGER - fixed a problem when changing a variable value
	  in the watch window.

    LIST - fix for /S with STDIN redirection (i.e., "list /s foo").
	
	SET - fix for erroneous error message with /V, /S, /U, and /D.
	
Build 40:
---------

    Fix for Vista bugs when piping to a child 4NT / TC process.
	
	Fix for other Vista bugs when loading the language dll's in
	  a child process.
	
    Minor corrections to French & German language dll's.
	
	@MAKEAGE - fixed a problem when only specifying a single
	  argument.
	  
	GOTO - fixed a problem with not aborting nested DO loops when
	  you use a GOTO without a /I.  (Note that if you use GOTO in
	  this fashion, E. Dijkstra will beat you with a lead pipe!)
	  
    KEYSTACK - fixed a problem when passing a too-long argument.
	
Build 39:
---------

    Fixed a problem with the BATCH.BCP file sometimes losing keywords
	  when batch debugger options are changed in OPTION.

Build 38:
---------

    LIST (4NT) - fix for a Windows bug with /C when running in TCI.
	
	LIST (4NT) - fixed an erratic problem with hex searches.
	
Build 37:
---------

    Help file updates.
	
    Fixed some problems with handling of DBCS languages.
	
	Worked around a sporadic Windows bug when attempting to delete file
	  streams to the recycle bin.
	  
	Added some additional functionality to the keystroke plugins.
	
	@LINKS will return "1" if Windows won't permit querying the file
	  (i.e., for things like "pagefile.sys").
	  
	@INODE will return "0000:0000" if Windows won't permit querying
	  the file (i.e., "pagefile.sys).

Build 36:
---------

    Public release of 4NT 8.0 and Take Command 8.0.


4NT 7.01 / Take Command 7.01

Build 370:
----------

    @SHAxx - changed the output to upper case to match the @MD5 and @CRC32
      functions.

    (Win x64 only) - kludged around an undocumented (bug? Feature?) Windows
      behavior when attempting to write to a file's SummaryInformation 
      stream.  (Windows x64 will read from the SummaryInformation stream,
      but will send a write to the Updt_SummaryInformation stream -- but
      only after also creating a 0-byte SummaryInformation stream!)

    DO - changed the /L behavior to accept strings beginning with a switch
      character (i.e., "do var in /L /stop") provided the string isn't also
      a valid switch character.

    Some minor corrections/additions to the online help.

Build 369:
----------

    @WINAPI - fixed a problem with passing Unicode strings to the API.
	 
	FOR - changed the /F option slightly to always parse a quoted string
	  as a string value, not a filename.  (Previously, it would parse an
	  string referring to an existing filename as a file, and a string
	  otherwise.)  The change was made for CMD.EXE compatibility; if you
	  have been using the /F option (not recommended, as there are MANY
	  better ways to do this in 4NT / TC!) you may need to edit your 
	  batch files / aliases.
	  
    KEYSTACK - worked around a Windows bug when invoking KEYSTACK the first
	  time from a hotkey (thanks to V. Fatica!).  
	  
	Some minor corrections to the online help.
	
Build 368:
----------

    4NT - Fixed a problem with calling HELP and the batch debugger from TCI.

Build 367:
----------

    Added a check in the CMD-style %~.. processing for the (inappropriate!) 
	  use of a single-character FOR variable name that is also in the valid
	  character list for %~.
	
    Changed the help & batch debugger windows so they work appropriately
	  in both TCI and "bare" 4NT mode.
	  
	TEE - added support for "con:".
	
Build 366:
----------

    Fix for an ATITools bug (caused a crash when loading 4NT).

    ON ERRORMSG - fixed a problem with the specified routine not
      being called.

Build 365:
----------

    Some minor corrections in the help text.
    
    Cosmetic fix for cosmetic issue (Windows problem) with pipes using
      the CPU time that would otherwise be used by the idle process.
    
    @SELECT - fixed a problem with very large files (which BTW are 
      definitely NOT recommended!).
      
    FOR - changed the argument parsing to disable switch characters as
      delimiters (to match changed CMD.EXE behavior).  For example,
      
        for %a in (1/2/3) do echo %a
	
      will now echo "1/2/3".
      
    FOR - fixed a couple of problems with the /T option.
    
    FOR - now allows embedded ")" characters in a filename if enclosed
      in double quotes.
      
    FOR - fixed a problem with (unnecessary) double %'s and the wacky
      CMD.EXE-style "%%~$PATH:x" variable substitution.
      
    SELECT (TC) - fixed a display problem with the SELECT file / char
      count on the status bar.
	  
Build 364:
----------

    BDEBUGGER - fixed a Windows bug when running 4NT in TCI (the
      BDEBUGGER window wouldn't display).
      
Build 363:
----------

    Some minor updates to the help.
    
    DESCRIBE - fixed a minor problem with DESCRIPT.ION not always
      being created hidden.
      
    RD - fixed a problem when (erroneously!) attempting to RD a file
      (not a directory) and NTFSDescriptions=Yes.
      
    Fixed a problem with various colorization routines (SCRPUT,
      directory colorization, etc.) when using double-wide character
      languages (such as Chinese and Japanese).
      
Build 362:
----------

    Some minor updates to the help.
    
    Fixed a problem with some obscure CMD.EXE syntax ("%var%=%value"
      was being interpreted by 4NT as an escape character rather than
      a trailing % for the variable name).
      
    Fixed a problem with @FORMATN when the number is < the precision.
    
    MSGBOX - fixed a problem with the messagebox size calculation when
      the text had multiple embedded tabs.
    
Build 362:
----------

    Added a workaround for a bug in Total Commander (creating lines
      in DESCRIPT.ION without trailing CR/LF's).

    @GETFILE - worked around a Windows resource bug that caused
      the filter option to fail erratically.
      
    @INIREAD - increased the maximum argument size from 511 to
      2047 characters.
      
    FTP - added a check for a valid port number following a trailing
      ':' (to work around a VAX issue with trailing colons in the
      directory names).   

Build 361:
----------

    4NT - fixed a problem with OPTION writing the Transparency
      directive as 0 (which caused a problem with ESET /W).  (You
      may need to delete an existing "Transparency=0" line in
      your 4NT.INI file.)
      
    @CHAR - increased maximum argument size from 511 to 2047
      characters.

Build 360:
----------

    The parser now deletes a DESCRIPT.ION file when it is empty.
    
    Added include list support to FTP / FTPS / IFTP.
    
    Fixed a problem with FTPS and unquoted arguments.
    
    DO - fixed a problem with /Sxxx on the DO command line being
      interpreted as a /S.
    
    LIST - fixed a problem with /E.

Build 359:
----------

    FTP - fixed a problem with non-standard FTP sites that don't
      accept a password.
      
    Take Command - fixed an erratic bug with some Caveman apps like
      "XCOPY /?".
      
    @CRC32, @MD5 - fixed a problem with leading spaces not being
      included in the hash code.  

    COPY - eliminated a (harmless but distracting) error message with
      the /O option and FTP targets.

    SET - fixed a problem with /A when omitting the % and the variable
	  is a negative number.

Build 358:
----------

    @READSCR - fixed a problem with the parser not recognizing the
	  function name.

Build 357:
----------

    4NT and Take Command can now optionally store the registration 
      info in a key file rather than in the registry.  This should
      allow you to use your registered copy on another machine via
      a usb key.  Note that this does NOT permit you to use a single
      license simultaneously on more than one machine!  You can
      download the key file versions (executable only; they don't
      include the installer) at ftp://jpsoft.com/4nt/inikey/4nt.exe
      and ftp://jpsoft.com/tcmd/inikey/tcmd.exe.  The keys will be
      stored in 4nt_keys.ini and tcmd_keys.ini.
      
Build 356:
----------

    Fixed a problem with Delphi plugins.

Build 355:
----------

    Optimized plugin references to speed up batch files.
    
    Colorized directories - fixed a problem (Windows change) with
      the "encrypted" keyword.
      
    FFIND - fixed a problem with regular expression searches in
      files > 4Mb.
      
    LIST - fixed a problem when toggling between ASCII & Unicode
      display with binary files.
      
    LOG - changed the behavior when logging errors & a "Usage" error
      is triggered -- it no longer displays the entire quick help
      syntax for an internal command.

Build 354:
----------

    Take Command - fixed a problem with Caveman apps that scroll
      backwards in the console buffer.
      
    Fixed a problem with tab completion and a leading (obsolete!)
      %+.

    Fixed a problem with filename completion with CompletePaths=Yes
      and include lists.

Build 353:
----------

    Take Command - fixed a couple of problems with Caveman and 
      maximized TC windows on large monitors.
    
    Shebang - fixed a problem when the .CMD file name had embedded
      whitespace.
      
    MSGBOX - increased the maximum prompt size from 1023 to 8191 
      characters.
   
      
Build 352:
----------

    FTP - added a workaround for the FTP server returning an invalid
      (fragmentary) directory entry.  (It only happens sporadically on
      one particular type of FTP server.)
      
    FTPS - fixed a problem when provided with an invalid certificate.
      
    ASSOC - fixed a problem (Windows API bug) when setting or deleting
      a value.
      
    COPY - added a workaround for a Windows bug/peculiarity that caused
      a strange (momentary) output on a COPY /G.
      
    COPY - will no longer return an error if /S is specified and a
      subdirectory has no matching files.
      
    FTYPE - fixed a problem (Windows API bug) when setting or deleting
      a value.
      

Build 351:
----------

    Take Command - worked around two Windows XP bugs that caused DOS
      apps run in Caveman to hang.
      
    @EVAL - fixed a problem with the string operators (i.e., MOD, SHL,
      etc.). 

    START - fixed a problem when starting an HTTPS or FTPS URL.
    
Build 350 (Initial release of 7.01)
-----------------------------------

  New Features:
  -------------

    Take Command - now supports piping in Caveman; also improved 
      Caveman compatibility & speed.  Removed the "STDIO app" option in
      Caveman, as it's now unnecessary with the Caveman changes.

    %_BDEBUGGER - returns 1 if the debugger is actively debugging a 
      batch file, 0 otherwise.
      
    %@EXECSTR - will now work even if redirection is disabled (SETDOS 
      /X-6).
      
    %@SERIAL - returns the serial number for the specified disk.

    @WINAPI - added an exception handler to avoid GPFs when passing
      invalid arguments to the Windows API.
      
    JPSTREE.IDX - no longer saves the SFN if Win32SFNSearch=No.  
      (This makes the CDD /S 50% faster, and the JPSTREE.IDX file 30%
      smaller.)

    IF - changed the ISPLUGIN test to return 1 if the argument is a plugin
      variable, function, or command (previously it only returned 1 for a
      command).
      
    PDIR - added support for directory colorization:
    
	/D - colorize directory.  Note that this is the opposite of the
	   DIR syntax -- DIR defaults to directory colorization enabled,
	   and /D turns it off.  PDIR default to colorization disabled,
	   and /D turns it on.
    
    REBOOT - added new switches:
    
	/K - lock workstation.  This option has the same result as 
	   pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del and clicking Lock Workstation. 
	   To unlock the workstation, the user must log in.
	
	/M or /M0 - switch the display to low power (standby)

	/M1 - shut off the display (system dependent; will not work on
	   all systems)

	/R - reboot.  This is the default, but is required if you specify
	   /M or /M1, in order to allow you shut off the monitor without
	   rebooting the system.
    
    REXEC - added support for double quoting the argument list.  (The 
      quotes will be removed before executing the commands but will
      prevent redirection from occurring on the local rather than the
      remote machine.)
    
    RSHELL - added support for double quoting the argument list.  (The 
      quotes will be removed before executing the commands but will
      prevent redirection from occurring on the local rather than the
      remote machine.)
    
    SET - changed the /A behavior to default non-existent variables to 0
      (to match CMD.EXE's behavior).

    SHRALIAS - If you have a SHRALIAS_SAVE_PATH environment variable set, 
      SHRALIAS will save the alias, history, dirhistory, and function lists 
      to the path specified by SHRALIAS_SAVE_PATH when SHRALIAS exits.  The 
      files will be saved in Unicode format; the filenames are:
      
          alias.sav
	  history.sav
	  dirhistory.sav
	  function.sav

    TAIL - added support for /N+n syntax in pipes.
    	   

  Bug Fixes:
  ----------

    Take Command - if you try to pipe to an unknown command in a child
      TC session, it will now pop up a error message box rather than
      displaying a message and then immediately exiting.
      
    Take Command - fixed a problem when starting TC as another user
      (via the "Run As" option).
      
    4NT - fixed a problem when running as a Caveman app in TC and scrolling
      past the end of the window.
      
    Redirection - fixed a problem with the (no longer valid) syntax
      "3>filename" keeping the handle to "filename" open.
      
    Fixed a problem with F9 & unmatched single quotes on the command line.
      
    Fixed a problem with F10 and CompletePaths=Yes.
    
    @AVERAGE - fixed a confusing return when no arguments are supplied.
    
    @CEILING / @FLOOR - fixed a problem with reporting both an error and
      a result when no arguments are supplied.
      
    @INC / @DEC - added support for exponent format (i.e., @inc[1e2]).
    
    @UNC - now strips double quotes (which are not needed anyway).
    
    BDEBUGGER - changed the "Save" button to act like the "Save" menu
      item rather than the "Save As" (provided the file is already named).
      
    CALL - fixed a problem with %* when using the (wacky) CMD.EXE syntax
      call :label ...
    
    CD / CDD - added an error message when the directory index is unavailable
      because another 4NT / TC process is updating it.
        
    CDD - fixed a problem with not displaying the "Indexing" message 
      the first time you do a fuzzy CD without a jpstree.idx file, 
      and another with using too much CPU time while indexing.
      
    COPY - changed the timestamp applied to a file copied from an FTP
      server back to the old (6.x) way.  (Attempting to show the same
      date/time as the FTP server was causing problems with COPY /U,
      among others.)
      
    COPY - fixed a problem with /N[est].
      
    DESCRIBE - fixed a problem when deleting files (it was inserting
      invalid entries with a "*" in the DESCRIPT.ION file).
      
    EVENTLOG - added a workaround for a problem in the Windows event
      viewer.
    
    FOR - fixed a problem with the /F "tokens..." syntax.
    
    FOR - fixed a problem with /F and empty FOR arguments.

    FOR - added a check for escape character processing within the
      argument set (for CMD compatibility).
      
    FOR - if you specify /R and the set does not include wildcards (i.e.,
      (.), FOR will enumerate the directory tree with the set argument
      appended.  (CMD.EXE compatibility issue, and I don't know *why*
      CMD is doing it or what it's for!)
