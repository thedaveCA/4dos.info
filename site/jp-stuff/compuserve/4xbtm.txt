 ============================================================================
 Present in earlier 4XBTM versions. May be enhanced, debugged, altered.
 ============================================================================

 XSP.BTM     : Set Prompt. This  is  based on Mike Bessy of JP Software's
               SETPROMP.BTM.  XSP  gives  you  access  to  13  different,
               highly informative prompts by choosing from menu / command
               line parameters. The ultimate megaprompt btm!

 XTOUCH.BTM  : A utility to change the date  and  time  stamps  of files.
               There was a heated discussion in Compuserve's  4DOS  forum
               over the proposal to add this function as an internal 4DOS
               command.  While we are waiting  for  that  implementation,
               here is an external one. Rewritten!

 XBOOTEX.BTM : Versatile  manager  of  programs / batches you want to run
               only once every  day  at  first  boot.   Unlimited  progs,
               selectable interval, selectable ask before execution.  Run
               CHKDSK every day, a virus scan once a week, defrag once  a
               month  if  you have the time?  Then XBOOTEX is the btm for
               you.

 XCORTIME.BTM  Correct Time utility. This is the btm way to automatically
               adjust your system clock, if it is off by a regular amount
               of seconds every day. Even handles necessary date changes.
               Install  XCORTIME  with  XBOOTEX and get your clock to run
               with accuracy of 1 second a week.

 XCD.BTM     : is  a Change Directory utility with a lot of features.  You
               can change to any directory on all your drives by giving no
               or  only  part of the name of the target dir.  If more than
               one match is found, you can choose from a menu.  XCD senses
               if  a directory is new or deleted and updates the database.

 XAD.BTM     : is an Administrator for  "screen savers" (After Dawn!). It
               provides a  random generator for (up to now) four examples
               of "screen savers" (not blankers!) named XBL1 ... XBL7.BTM
               Naturally these are not TSR`s and don`t stop until you hit
               any key.
 XPATH.BTM   : is a utility to add dir names to your path.

 XDDEL.BTM   : Directory Delete with as much safety as possible (for me).
               Dir  entries  are  shown  before  you  decide  to  delete.
               Protects  against  wrong  input,  boot drive deletion etc.

 XPNG.BTM    : Prune and Graft  tree  limbs  from a nd  to your directory
               tree. See what you'll do before it's done.

 XDREN.BTM   : Rename a directory.

 XND.BTM     : Multiple new  Directories  (and  subdirs!) at one go!

 XFA.BTM     : File Attribute change with the help of SELECT.  Shows only
               files with matching attribute.  Only 1 attribute at a time.

 XFMT.BTM    : User interface for FORMAT.COM. Format diskette(s)  with  a
               friendly interface, all imaginable safeguards. Rewritten!

 XDC.BTM     : Disk Copy utility with copy across different formats, sys-
               tem files recognition, label.  Formats  or  clears  target
               disk automatically (after confirmation by user).

 XER.BTM     : shows last internal,  external  ,  DOS and programm errors
               with an explanation  where  possible.   Very  useful  when
               writing batch files, especially in conjunction with XSP 7.

 XFF.BTM     : File Find utility.  Searches all your  hard  disks  for  a
               match  for the given filespec.  Shows matches in list with
               option to change to that dir.

 XLIST.BTM   : is a directory and file lister with not quite as much fea-
               tures  as  V.   Buerg's  LIST.COM.   Decides automatically
               between   text   and   hex   listing   for   some    files
               (configurable).   Lets  you  decide  to  return to home or
               current dir on ESC.

 XSC.BTM     : Set your coloured prompt and screen foreground / background
               with menu, example screen.

 XSET.BTM    : Edit existing aliases / environment variables. Picklist to
               choose from matching specs. New user interface.

 XSI.BTM     : System Info making the most of 4DOS variables.

 XUZ.BTM     : Unzipper  for  downloads  from  mailbox.

 XZIP.BTM    : Zipper for uploads to mailboxes.

 XRT.BTM     : This is a Reaction Timer meant as a game to show the power
               of 4DOS to your friends on parties.

 XBESAFE.BTM : Safely store the critical WINDOWS files and NDW files in a
               self-extracting archive for easy restoration.  If you ever
               experienced   the   General  Protection  Fault  caused  by
               corrupted NDW groups this one is for you.

 XDAILY.BTM  : Programm execution only  once  daily  at  boot.   Slightly
               adapted  for  4XBTM from ONCEADAY.BTM as distributed by JP
               Software with 4DOS.

 XTS.BTM     : Text Search utility.  Very useful!  You can enter any text
               and a filespec and XTS will find that text in those files,
               show you where (file name, line number) it  is  found  and
               lets  you  list  it.  To get even more out of XTS, you can
               change from 4DOS internal LIST to LIST.COM  from  V. Buerg
               and  then  you  can  directly  edit,  copy or delete those
               files.

 XDSKCAT.BTM : Disk Catalogue Utility. You can catalogue   your    floppy
               disks, look for filenames, list disks, look for free space
               on disks etc.  It is menudriven and should explain itself.

 XDEREM.BTM  : Delete remarks, leading blanks  and  empty  lines  from  a
               batch and use BATCOMP on it.  For those of you who like to
               spend a few minutes to save microseconds.

 XFS.BTM     : File  Size  Utility:  modelled  after  P. Norton's  FS, it
               shows  you the total size of selected files.  While you do
               not get info about the slack area of each  file,  you  get
               intermediate sums, and you can (4DOS)select files that are
               not covered by wildcards.  See XDSIZE, too, for  directory
               size.

 XCLEAN.BTM  : Clean  your  drives  of  zero-length  files  and  unwanted
               backups and / or temp files.  User-configurable.

 XTEL.BTM    : A phone number dialler.  Look  up  your  contacts  with  a
               search string and let XTEL dial their number.

 XXTEL.BTM   : More elaborate phone number dialler.  Works interactively,
               reports BUSY line etc.  May not  work  with  every  modem.

 XPURGE.BTM  : Delete  your  files  safely.  With XPURGE purged files are
               moved to a hidden directory (\XPURGE on your  boot  drive)
               and stored until you decide to clean them out.

 XUNPURGE.BTM: Restore  XPURGEd  files  to  current or original home dir.
               Clean \XPURGE directory.  Menudriven.

 XDOUBLE.BTM : Utility to find  duplicate  files  (doubles)  across  your
               drive(s) with info about age and a  reasonable guess as to
               what they are.

 XFFD.BTM    : Find Files by Date range and  go  to  directory  of  found
               files.

 XFFS.BTM    : Find  Files  by  Size  range  and go to directory of found
               files.

 XFFDESC.BTM : Find Files by Description and go to directory.

 XPW.BTM     : Password utility. Enter your correct password or stop your
               system. May deter a not very sophisticated attempt to  get
               at your data.

 XWIPE.BTM   : Utility  to  wipe  the  info in a file before deleting it.
               CAUTION: Recovering the information of a wiped file is NOT
               possible!

 XDSIZE.BTM  : Directory Size utility. Sizes  and percentages of disk use
               for selected directories.

 XIN.BTM     : CD to FIRST subdir.  Dir navigation  in  conjunction  with
               XOVER.BTM

 XOVER.BTM   : CD to  NEXT  subdir.   Dir  navigation in conjunction with

 XFREN.BTM   : Multiple File REName utility with the help of SELECT.

 XDSKFILL.BTM: XDSKFILL creates an empty file on the disk of your  choice
               named  XDUMMY.DAT.   This file can be any size, default is
               all of remaining disk space.  As only  1  byte  is  really
               written  to  the file, you can view, edit and save textual
               information of deleted files in the  former  slack  space.
               With   XWIPE   you  can  then  erase  all  information  in
               XDUMMY.DAT   for   security   reasons.

 XDN.BTM     : Directory Navigation by cursor  and  enter  keys.   Really
               only  a  stripped down XLIST.BTM, but there seems to be an
               endless  demand   for   different   directory   navigation
               utilities.

 XDOSDEV.BTM : DOS DEVice segment adress display with DIR command! One of
               the quirks of all DOS versions is that if you issue a  DIR
               command  with  a  device name like CON or LPT1, the device
               name will be displayed with a filesize that in reality  is
               the decimal form of the (hexadecimal) segment adress.

 XCOPYD.BTM  : XCOPY  to diskette with prompt for new diskette, so you do
               not have to remember which files are already copied.

 XBL1.BTM    : Screen savers for XAD.BTM
 XBL2.BTM    :
 XBL3.BTM    :
 XBL4.BTM    :
 XBL5.BTM    :
