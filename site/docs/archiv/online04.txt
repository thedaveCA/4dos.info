 >>> Major Upgrades for 4DOS, 4NT, and Take Command/32 <<<

----------------------------------------------------------------------

New Releases Offer FTP Support - and Over 200 Other Enhancements


JP Software is pleased to announce the release of version 7.0 of 4DOS,
version 4.0 of 4NT, and version 3.0 of Take Command/32!

All products are fully compatible with the latest operating systems
including Windows NT / 2000 and Windows 95 /98 / ME.  And all have
been updated with a host of new features - here's just a small sample:

    FTP Support:

        The single biggest enhancement in these versions is FTP
        support (in 4NT and Take Command).  This support extends
        across many commands and functions (e.g. you can use most file
        oriented commands -- COPY, DEL, MOVE, REN, TYPE, etc.  -- on
        FTP servers).  It enables file management on FTP servers from
        the command line, and brings all of the capabilities of 4NT
        and Take Command/32's enhanced batch scripting language to
        automation of FTP transfers.  It's an important tool for web
        developers, and anyone maintaining a web or FTP server and
        needing to manage it using familiar commands, and/or automate
        their work.  See the first "Tech Tip" below for details on how
        to use these features.

    @file Lists:

        Another significant addition, "@file" lists, adds even more
        flexibility to file processing, allowing you to take a list of
        files generated by another command, or another application,
        and use it as input to any file processing command.  Use @file
        lists to find text in files and then process only those files
        containing the matching text, to change the order in which
        files are copied or moved, or use the same file lists for
        internal commands and external applications with similar
        features (e.g.  .ZIP file tools).  See the second "Tech Tip"
        below for more information.

    Usability Improvements:

        We've also added plenty of little things that help with
        usability - like server and sharename completion on the
        command line, variable name completion, a more robust way to
        handle standard text-mode applications in Take Command/32, and
        dozens more.  And there are over 100 enhancements to existing
        commands, giving you more command line power and flexibility
        than ever.

    Batch File Enhancements:

        For batch programmers, this release offers a wide range of
        additional enhancements, including over 40 new variables and
        functions that offer capabilities like manipulation of the
        Windows registry, access to Windows system data, new
        arithmetic calculations, additional date handling, and access
        to new Windows 2000 file attributes.

The price for all this?  Just $34.95 for the first product, $19.95 for
each additional product, or $54.95 for the JP CD Suite.  Plus if you
currently have one or more individual products you can convert to the
CD Suite with all products for just $69.95!

Additional enhancements in this version include the following:

    * In addition to FTP support, COPY, MOVE, and REN also support
      file management on HTTP and HTTPS servers (in 4NT and Take
      Command/32).

    * The maximum batch file nesting depth has been increased from 10
      to 16 (4DOS) or 32 (4NT and TC32).

    * 4DOS now has mouse support for the popup windows (history list,
      directory history, @SELECT, etc.) and for the SELECT command.

    * New commands in 4NT and Take Command/32 include EVENTLOG, IFTP,
      KEYSTACK, PLAYAVI, PLAYSOUND, PRINT, QUERYBOX, SENDMAIL,
      SHORTCUT, TASKEND, TASKLIST, and WHICH.

    * New commands in 4DOS include LFNFOR and WHICH.

    * There are over 100 new features in 4DOS, 4NT, and Take
      Command/32 commands, including:

        - CDD can now update specific drives or directories in the
          extended directory search database, without deleting and
          recreating the entire database.

        - DEL (and RD /S) in 4NT and Take Command/32 now delete files
          to the recycle bin, and you can disable this behavior or
          change the default with switches and a .INI file directive.

        - DIR has support for Windows 2000 junction points, a way to
          disable default options, and new options for cleaner summary
          (/U) output.

        - GOSUB now supports passing parameters to subroutines.

        - LIST has new options to delete a file or to save pipe
          output.

        - TOUCH can now select files by attribute (including setting
          the date and time for directories under Windows NT/2000),
          and "transfer" file dates / times from one file to another.

        - UNALIAS and UNSET now support wildcard deletions.

    * There are almost 50 new internal variables and functions,
      including new date-related capabilities, registry access (in 4NT
      and Take Command/32), numeric min / max calculation, and many
      more.

    * 4NT and Take Command/32 now support the additional Windows 2000
      file attributes (encrypted, temporary, compressed, etc.).

    * Take Command's Caveman feature to capture output from character
      mode applications has a number of internal enhancements to
      improve support for all applications, and also offers a new
      "STDIO" option which provides significantly better support for
      applications which only generate sequential output.

For additional details see the "What's New" section of the online help
for each product.  A file with essentially the entire list of changes
is also available -- check the ASCII files area of our web site at
http://www.jpsoft.com/ for WHATSNEW.TXT.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

      (Our normal office hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, eastern US
      time.)  Telephone coverage and response time may be affected by
      the upgrade workload; if you have difficulty reaching us, use
      the web site to place your order, or leave a voice mail and we
      will call you back.

    * Via fax to 781-646-0904, or email to sales@jpsoft.com.  Please
      include name and address, exact items desired, email and
      telephone contact information, and full credit card details with
      all orders.

    * By mail to P.O. Box 1470, E. Arlington, MA 02474.

upgrade order form, available from the ASCII files area of our web
site in the file UPGFORM.TXT (for upgrades) or ORDFORM.TXT (for new
customers).

Single-system upgrade pricing is as follows:

    4DOS 5.5* or above, 4NT 2.5* or above, or any version of Take
    Command:  just $34.95 for the first product and $19.95 for each
    additional product, plus shipping.

    JP CD Suite:  $54.95 plus shipping.

    products:  $69.95 plus shipping.

For multi-system license upgrade pricing see
http://www.jpsoft.com/mlprice.htm, or contact us for a quote.

(* Individual product upgrades from earlier versions -- 4DOS 5.0 or
below, or 4NT 2.0 or below -- are $10 additional for the first
product.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Electronic and Physical Shipment Schedule

Initially these new versions will be available for electronic delivery
only (electronic delivery consists of an email message with your
serial number and code, and an attached program to install the serial
number in the software).  This is due to production issues with
printed manuals and physical media; we expect to be able to ship
physical copies and manuals approximately August 1, 2001.

If you place an order for electronic or "dual" (physical and
electronic) delivery we will charge your credit card now, ship the
electronic portion of your order now, and hold the physical portion
(if any) until physical materials are available.  If you place an
order for physical delivery only, it will be held until after the
materials are available, and your credit card will not be charged
until it is shipped.

Orders will be processed and shipped in the order in which they are
received.  Note that there may be noticeable delays in order
processing due to the unusually high workload during the upgrade
period.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Downloading the New Version

The new versions are available from our web site at
http://www.jpsoft.com/download.htm, or direct from our FTP site at
ftp://ftp.jpsoft.com.

On the FTP site look for these files:

    4DOS v7.0:  4dos/4dos700.exe

    4NT v4.0:  4nt/4nt400.exe

    Take Command/32 v3.0:  tcmd32/tc32300.exe


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Automatic Upgrades


If you purchased 4DOS, 4NT, or Take Command/32 (or a pack or CD which
contained any of these products) on or after January 1, 2001 you will
receive an upgrade automatically.

Also if you purchased any special offer which included 4DOS 6.0 or
above, 4NT 3.0 or above, or Take Command/32 2.0 or above and which
also included the next version "free", you will also receive an
upgrade automatically.

Automatic upgrades will be sent by email, and will include new brand
codes and a new brand program to be used with a downloaded trial copy
of each product being upgraded.  You can not use your old brand codes
and program with the new versions.

Due to our upgrade workload, automatic upgrades may take up to one to
two weeks to process after the product release.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

4OS2, Take Command/16, and Take Command for OS/2


4OS2, Take Command/16, and Take Command for OS/2 are not being upgraded
due to the declining number of users for the corresponding operating
systems (OS/2 and Windows 3.x), and the corresponding dramatic drop in
demand for these products.

However, these products are still supported and we will do our best to
answer technical questions from OS/2 and Windows 3.x users.  We also
plan to offer maintenance upgrades to 4OS2 and Take Command for OS/2
later this summer to correct a few minor problems.

 >>> Tech Tips <<<

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the New FTP Features


4NT 4.0 and Take Command/32 3.0 include a range of features which
allow you to manage files on FTP servers.  The primary FTP features
are:

    * FTP support in file processing commands including COPY, DEL,
      DIR, FFIND, LIST, MOVE, MD, RD, REN, SELECT, and TYPE.

    * The new IFTP command, which lets you open an FTP site and leave
      it open for subsequent use by other commands.

    * FTP support in other file-related commands and features,
      including the CD command, filename completion, and file- and
      directory-oriented variables and variable functions.

The simplest way to access a file on an FTP site is to use its name in
a command, like this:

     copy "ftp://ftp.jpsoft.com/4dos/4dos700.exe" d:\jpsoft\

This will perform an anonymous login to the FTP site, and copy the
named file.  FTP file names must always be in quotes, and can include
wildcards, for example:

     copy "ftp://ftp.jpsoft.com/4nt/*" d:\jpsoft\

Note that we use forward slashes in the FTP URL passed to the command.
This is the norm for FTP and is required in most cases; some servers
may accept backslashes as well.

Commands like those shown above will open and close the FTP server for
every command.  If you plan to perform multiple commands on the same
server it is much faster to open the connection to the server once,
with IFTP, use it for multiple commands, then close it, for example:

     iftp "ftp://ftp.jpsoft.com/"
     copy "ftp:4dos/4dos700.exe" d:\jpsoft\
     copy "ftp:4nt/*" d:\jpsoft\
     iftp /c

Note that once the site is opened with IFTP, the server name
("//ftp.jpsoft.com/") should be left out of the command as it is
implied by the initial "ftp:".  Most FTP servers have a time limit on
inactive connections, so if you open a connection with IFTP and then
don't use it for a while, it may be closed by the server, and have to
be reopened.

You can also specify a user name and password in any command which
uses a full FTP server name, for example:

     iftp "ftp://user:pass@ftp.something.com/"    or
     copy "ftp://user:pass@ftp.something.com/file1.txt" .\

When you have opened a site with IFTP, you can change the current
directory with CD.  The changes can be relative, or absolute (i.e.
with a full path specified), for example:

     cd "ftp:data"
     cd "ftp:/main/data"

Remember that the "root" directory for your FTP connection is not
necessarily the root directory of the actual FTP server.  Instead, it
is usually the "home" directory selected by the server's administrator
for the user name (or anonymous login) you used to connect to the
server.

There are several small glitches you can run into when accessing FTP
servers.  Many servers don't report properly to 4NT or Take Command/32
whether a name you pass is actually a directory or a file.  For
example, if you try this command to see the contents of the directory
"/data":

     dir "ftp://jpsoft.com/data"

what you are really asking for is a directory of all files in the
directory, i.e.  "data/*".  If the server responds as if the name
belonged to a file and not a directory, the results will be incorrect.
You can usually work around this by explicitly specifying what you
want, for example:

     dir "ftp://jpsoft.com/data/*"

You may also find that when you send files to an FTP server
(especially a Unix server) you want them to be copied with lower case
names, but the names on your local system are in upper case.  You can
address this with the FOR command and the %@LOWER variable function.
For example, this command may create files on the server in upper
case:

     copy *.html "ftp:/htdocs/"

But this one will force the names to lower case:

     for %file in (*.html) copy %file "ftp:/htdocs/%@lower[%file]"

You can also create an alias like the following to make this easier.
This alias assumes an FTP connection was already opened with IFTP.
Remember that this is an example only, you may need to adjust it to
meet your needs and your server's behavior:

     alias fcopy `for %f in (%1) copy %f "ftp:%2/%@lower[%file]"`
     fcopy *.html /htdocs

4NT and Take Command use standard FTP commands to retrieve information
about files and directories and manipulate those files and directories
on FTP servers, and rely on the server's compliance with Internet FTP
standards.  If your server is not fully compliant, or does not operate
in the manner that 4NT and Take Command expect, the results may not be
what you intend.  For example, FTP servers are supposed to be case-
insensitive; if the server you are connecting to is not, you may have
to use the stored case of file and directory names when you use FTP
commands.  We urge you to test each server you use with nondestructive
commands like DIR before you try to copy or delete files, create or
remove directories, etc.

Before you can use the built-in FTP support or the IFTP command, you
must establish the necessary connection to the Internet.  For example,
if you use Windows Dial-Up Networking to connect to the Internet, you
must start your dial up connection first.

File Processing with @file Lists


All of our new releases have a feature in many file processing
commands that used to be available just in the FOR command:  "@file"
lists that let you specify the names of files to be processed in a
text file.  You may be familiar with similar features in other
applications, such as PKZIP.  We call these "@file lists" because the
"@" sign is used in the command, preceding the list filename.

An @file list is simply a standard ASCII file containing the names of
the files to process, one per line.  This allows you to create a list
of files for processing using output from DIR /B, DIR /F, or FFIND, a
text editor, or any other method that produces a file in the proper
format.  Paths may be included in the file; see below for details.

@File lists are supported by the ATTRIB, COPY, DEL / ERASE, DESCRIBE,
EXCEPT, LIST, MOVE , RD / RMDIR, REN / RENAME, TOUCH, and TYPE
commands.

To use an @file list, precede its name with an "@" sign in the
command.  For example, to copy all of the files listed in MYLIST.TXT
to D:\SAVE\:

     [c:\] copy @mylist.txt d:\save\

If you use a drive and/or path specification the "@" sign can appear
before the path or before the file name.  For example, these are
equivalent:

     [c:\] copy @e:\lists\mylist.txt d:\save\
     [c:\] copy e:\lists\@mylist.txt d:\save\

One of the most common uses for @file lists is to use FFIND's ability
to search for text in files, then perform another command on all the
files with matching text.  For example, this command finds all .TXT
files which contain the word "mango".  The /S tells FFIND to search
the current directory and all of its subdirectories, and /B makes the
output a list of names only (without the actual lines which matched):

     ffind /b /s /t"mango" *.txt

If you saved the output of this command in a file you could use it as
input to another command, for example:

     ffind /b /s /t"mango" *.txt > manglist.txt
     copy @manglist.txt d:\save\

Similarly, DIR output can be used to process a group of files with
finer control than might otherwise be possible.  For example, this
command will TYPE all of the matching files:

     type rec*.txt

Output from this command will be in the order the files are stored in
the directory.  To control the order, use DIR to generate a list in
the desired order, then use an @file list to TYPE the files.  For
example, to process the files in reverse date order:

     dir /b /o:-d rec*.txt > reclist.txt
     type @reclist.txt

The entries in @file lists may contain no path, a relative path, or an
absolute path, for example:

     file1
     mydir\file1
     d:\data\mydir\file1

If a filename has no path the command processor will look for the file
in the directory that is current when the operation takes place.
Similarly, if a relative path is used it will be interpreted as
relative to the directory that is current when the operation takes
place.

@file lists should not be used with the subdirectory switches in file
processing commands (COPY /S, DEL /S, etc.).  To process files listed
in a single @file list across multiple subdirectories use FOR's
ability to read the list and handle each file name individually, for
example:

     for %file in (@flist) copy /s %file d:\target\

For additional information on @file lists see the corresponding
section under File Selection in the online help.
