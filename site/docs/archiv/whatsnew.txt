NEW VERSION OVERVIEW -  Take Command and 4NT 6.01
------------------------------------------------- 

Since the last major release we've added numerous new features, commands, 
switches, variables, and other enhancements to 4NT and Take Command! 

This is a summary of the compatibility fixes and new features.  For complete 
details, see the appropriate topics in the online help. 

New and modified features: 
------------------------- 

    4NT and Take Command have been rewritten to share a common .DLL 
      (TakeCmd.dll).  This means they will use much less memory when 
      you have multiple shells open.   

    The Caveman support in Take Command has improved compatibility and
      speed.
	  
    4NT and Take Command use a new IPWORKS version (IPWORKS6.DLL and  
      IPWSSL6.DLL). 

    4NT - no longer needs a separate KEYSTACK.EXE (it's built into 
      TakeCmd.dll). 

    4NT and Take Command now recognize Windows 2003. 

    Added FTPS (SSL FTP) support. 

    Added HTTPS (SSL HTTP) support.   

    Added TFTP (trivial FTP) support.  

    4NT and TC will now look for your FTP user names and passwords in the 
      file "FTP.CFG", which is kept in the 4NT or TC directory by default 
      (you can specify another directory with the FTPCFG .INI directive). 
               
    Added a new type of redirection (like the *nix "here-document") using  
      the "program << word" syntax. 
        
    You can now preface an .INI filename on the startup line with a / to 
      work around a Windows problem with not displaying the entire command  
      line in a shortcut when an argument begins with @. 

    Increased key substitution table from 64 to 128 entries. 

    Increased command line length to 8191 characters, and maximum length 
      (after expansion) to 16383 characters. 

    Increased maximum number of arguments per batch file command line  
      to 511. 
       
    Increased the global alias list size to 128K characters. 
     
    Increased the global user function list size to 64K characters. 

    Removed nesting limits for DO and IFF. 

    User functions now support the %# variable (number of arguments 
      passed to the function). 
       
    The user function parsing has been changed so that the switch character 
      ('/') is not considered a parameter delimiter.   
       
    The environment variable TreeExclude specifies which drives & directories 
      to ignore when updating the JPSTREE.IDX file.  
         
    Take Command will now pop up the context menu when you press the context 
      key at the prompt. 

    Take Command - added right-click context menu support for pasting
      into Caveman apps.


New and modified .INI directives: 
-------------------------------- 

    FTPCFG=filename - the full path & filename for the FTP.CFG file (see 
      above). 

    ProxyUser - A user name if Basic authentication is to be used for the  
      HTTP proxy.  
       
    ProxyPassword - A password if Basic authentication is to be used for  
      the HTTP proxy.  

    SSLPort=n - The port for the FTP SSL service.  If not specified, or if 
      SSLPort is set to 0 (its default value), SSL uses the default SSL port 
      (21).  For implicit SSL, use port 990 (SSLPort=990). 
  
    SSLProvider=xxx - The name of the security provider to use.  The default 
      value is "*", which selects the default SSL provider defined in the  
      system. (On Windows, this is "Microsoft Unified Security Protocol  
      Provider".)  
       
    SSLStartMode=n - specify how to start SSL negotiation. 
     
        0 (default) If the remote port is set to the standard plaintext  
          port of the protocol, SSL will behave the same as if SSLStartMode  
          is set to 2 (sslExplicit). In all other cases, SSL negotiation will 
          be  implicit (sslImplicit).   
        1 (sslImplicit) The SSL negotiation will start immediately after the  
          connection is established.   
        2 (sslExplicit) Connection will first be in plaintext, and then SSL  
          negotiation will be explicitly started through a protocol command 
          such as STARTTLS.   
        3 (sslNone) No SSL negotiation, no SSL security. All communication  
          will be in plaintext mode.   

    UnicodeOutput=NO|yes - disable / enable Unicode output for redirection. 
      (This option will be overridden by a /A or /U option on the startup 
      command line.) 

    UpperCase - has been removed (it was only relevant to 4DOS). 
   

New and modified internal Variables: 
----------------------------------- 

    %_ALT - returns 1 if either Alt key is depressed. 
     
    %_BATCHTYPE - returns 0 if the current batch file is a normal .BTM,

      output; otherwise returns 0. 

    %_DISK - if the current directory is a UNC rather than a mapped 
      drive, %_disk will now return the sharename (previously it 
      returned an empty string). 
       
    %_NDP - obsolete; removed. 
    
     
New and modified variable functions: 
--------------------------------- 

    @AGEDATE - converts the numeric argument (FILETIME - the number of 
      100ns intervals since 1601) to a Date/Time pair, in the format: 

   20-04-2004,20:28:00.000 

      (@AGEDATE accepts an optional second parameter to specify the date 
      format.) 

    @COLOR - displays the color common dialog and returns the RGB value 
      (as a string in the form "r,g,b"; i.e. "0,128,64".  You can specify 
      the initially selected color in the same format; i.e., to select 
      bright red, "%@color[255,0,0]" 

    @CONSOLE - returns 1 if the specified window title belongs to a 
      console window.  (The title can include wildcards.) 

    @CWD - new function to return the current directory on the specified
      drive. (The returned string includes the drive spec.) The syntax is:
	  
        @cwd[d:]
		
    @CWDS - new function, like @CWD, but ensures there is a trailing \ on 
      the returned directory name.
	
    @DIRSTACK - returns the nth directory stack entry (most recent=0). 
      (The directory stack is the PUSHD / POPD stack.)  If no argument 
      is specified, return the total number of entries. 
       
    @DOMAIN (Unicode & Win2K+ only) - new function to return the domain 
      (if any) for the specified computer.  The syntax is:
	  
        @domain[name]
	
      where "name" is the DNS or NetBIOS name of the computer to query.  If
      no name is specified, @DOMAIN returns the domain for the local computer.
	
	@ENUMSERVERS - enumerate the servers on the network. 
   
    @ENUMSHARES - enumerate the sharenames for the specified server.  
  
    @EXPAND - added support for ranges.  The range must be the first argument,
      with a space before the filename.  For example:

        echo %@expand[/[d-5] *.doc]

    @FIELDS - returns the number of fields in the string.   
     
    @FILEAGE - changed internally to use the FILETIME format, a 64-bit 
      integer of the number of 100ns intervals since 1601 to the file 
      date & time. 

    @FILES - added support for ranges.  The range must be the first argument,
      with a space before the filename.  For example:

        echo %@files[/[d-5] *.doc]

    @FINDFIRST - added support for ranges.  The range must be the first argument,
      with a space before the filename.  For example:

        echo %@findfirst[/[d-5] *.doc]

    @FORMATN - format a numeric value.   

    @HISTORY - returns a previous line from the command history, or 
      optionally a specific word from that line.   
     
    @INSERT - added support for negative position.  (If the first argument
      is negative, the insertion will be made counting backwards from the
      end of the string.)

    @IPADDRESS - returns the IP address for the specified name. 

    @IPNAME - returns the name for the specified IP address. 

    @ISALNUM - returns 1 for alphabetic or numeric (0 - 9) characters. 
       
    @ISALPHA - returns 1 for alphabetic characters. 
     
    @ISASCII - returns 1 for ASCII characters (0x00 û 0x7F). 
     
    @ISCNTRL - returns 1 if the character(s) is a control character 
      (0x00 û 0x1F or 0x7F). 
       
    @ISDIGIT - returns 1 for decimal digits (0 û 9).  
     
    @ISPRINT - returns 1 for printable characters. 
     
    @ISPUNCT - returns 1 for any printable character that is not a space  
      or alphanumeric. 
       
    @ISSPACE - returns 1 for white-space characters (0x09 û 0x0D or 0x20). 
     
    @ISXDIGIT - returns 1 for hexadecimal digits (A û F, a û f, or 0 û 9). 
      
    @LTRIM - remove the specified leading characters that are in the 
      (quoted) first argument.   
       
    @MD5 - returns the MD5 hash for a file or string.   
     
    @REGDELKEY - deletes the specified key and all of its subkeys.  BE 
      VERY, VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS! 

    @REGEXIST - returns 1 if the specified key exists. 
    
    @RTRIM - remove the specified trailing characters that are in the 
      (quoted) first argument.   

    @SUBST - substitute a string at the specified position.  
     
    @TRUNCATE - new function that truncates the specified file at the current 
      file pointer position. The syntax is: 
  
        @truncate[n]
    
      where "n" is a file handle returned by @FILEOPEN.  (You must have opened
      the file for write access.) 

     @UNC - returns the UNC name for the specified file (or an error if 
      the file nas no UNC -- i.e., a local file). 

    @WORKGROUP (Unicode & Win2K+ only)- new function to return the 
      workgroup (if any) for the specified computer.  The syntax is:
	  
        @dworkgroup[name]
	
      where "name" is the DNS or NetBIOS name of the computer to query.
      If no name is specified, @WORKGROUP returns the workgroup for the 
      local computer.

    Most variable functions that take numeric arguments (@CHAR, @CLIP, 
      @COLOR, @DIRSTACK, @FIELD, @FILEREAD, @FILESEEK, @FILESEEKL,  
      @FILEWRITE, @FILEWRITEB, @HISTORY, @INSERT, @INSTR, @LEFT, @LINE, 
      @MAX, @MIN, @REPEAT, @RIGHT, @SUBST, @SUBSTR, @WINSYSTEM, @WORD)  
      will take either decimal or hex (prefaced with a "0x") input.   
      (For example, "@CHAR[65]" or "@CHAR[0x41]".) 
  
    @ATTRIB - added support for the documented but non-existent attribute 
      and/or selection.  (Uses the same syntax as the /A:xxxx attribute 
      specification for file selection.) 
       
    @EVAL - now supports hex output.  The syntax is @eval[...=H].  For 
      example, "echo %@eval[3*6=H]" will output "12". 
       
    @FILESEEKL - added an optional third argument.  If it is set to 1, 
      @FILESEEKL will seek from the current position, not from the 
      beginning of the file. 
  
    @MAKEAGE - now converts the specified date & time to a FILETIME format 
      (100ns intervals since 1601).  


New and updated commands: 
------------------------ 

    BATCOMP - is now an internal command (no BATCOMP32.EXE).  It also 
      now includes the /E (encrypt) switch, previously only available in 
      the runtime versions. 

    BDEBUGGER - Calls the new batch debugger.  The debugger is much more 
      powerful than the previous one, and includes support for breakpoints, 
      bookmarks, syntax coloring, and editing.   

    PDIR - like DIR, but with user-definable fields.   
    
    SMPP - lightweight message transfer, normally to text-enabled cell 
      phones.   
       
    The internal commands that take numeric arguments (ACTIVATE, BEEP,  
      CANCEL, DO, DRAWxxx, FOR, INKEY, INPUT, QUIT, START, WINDOW) will  
      now also accept hex format (leading "0x"). 
       
    ALIAS - if there is only a single argument and it contains wildcards 
      (* or ?), ALIAS will display matching alias names. 

    COPY - added check for /U with filesystems with different time 
      resolutions (uses coarsest resolution). 

    COPY - added support for TFTP. 
     
    COPY - now supports "copy con: "ftp:...". 

    COPY - (XP only) added /D switch to force a copy of an encrypted file 
      even when the target will be decrypted (CMD compatibility). 

    COPY - the /N switch now displays how many files would be copied. 
     
    COPY - the /P(rompt) switch will no longer turn off the /Q(uiet) 
      switch.  (A /P and /Q will still prompt for the filenames, but 
      it will not display the totals.) 

    COPY - the /V switch now does a true byte-by-byte comparison between 

      the source and the newly-created target file (unlike CMD). 

    COPY - the /G option when combined with /V will now show the percent
      verified.
	
    DEL - the /N switch now displays how many files would be deleted. 
     
    DEL - you can now exclude files from the recycle bin (if RecycleBin=Yes 
      is set, or if you use the /R option) with the RecycleExclude  
      environment variable.  
      
    DEL - the /P(rompt) switch will no longer turn off the /Q(uiet) 
      switch.  (A /P and /Q will still prompt for the filenames, but 
      it will not display the totals.) 

    DESCRIBE - has a new option "/U" to update the DESCRIPT.ION file  
      (deleting the descriptions for any nonexistent files).   
        
    DIR - changed the /: display when combined with /B or /F to remove 
      the stream size and the indenting to the filename column.  A /F and  
      /: will display the filename on the first line, then any streams 
      appended to the filename on subsequent lines. 
       
    DIR - added additional attribute types to directory colorization:

        Encrypted
        Normal
        Temporary
        Sparse
        Junction
        Compressed
        Offline
        Notindexed

     DO - has a new option "UNTIL DATETIME" to execute the DO loop until 
      the specified date (ISO format) and time (24-hour format).   
     
    ENDLOCAL - has a new switch "/D" to export the current directory  
     (don't restore the original directory saved by SETLOCAL). 
    
    ENDLOCAL - the "export environment variables" list now supports  
      wildcards. 

    ESET - has a new switch "/W" to edit the variable, alias, or function  
      list in a popup window (as used by the batch debugger).   
     
    FFIND - has new options "/+n" to skip the first "n" matches and "/-n"  
      to stop after "n" matches 
         
    FOR - added the command "LEAVEFOR" to terminate a FOR loop (like the 
      LEAVE command in DO). 
       
    FUNCTION - if there is only a single argument and it contains 
      wildcards (* and/or ?), FUNCTION will display matching function 
      names. 
       
    HEAD - added support for HTTP and HTTPS files.  

    HELP - does a better job of determining which help you want when the 
      name conflicts with an internal command.  If the name begins with 
      a @, it will look for a variable function.  If the name begins with  
      a "//", it will look for an .INI directive. 
       
    HISTORY - you can now exclude commands from the history list by 
      setting the HistoryExclude environment variable.   
         
    IF - added EQC (case-sensitive test) 

    IF - the ISAPP test now checks if the argument has a path and will only 
      match processes with a matching path. 
           
    IF - added the ISFILE test to check for the existence of the specified
      file.  (ISFILE was added because Microsoft changed IF EXIST to return
      1 if either a file or directory exists.  This made it impossible to
      check for an empty directory because "." and ".." always exist.)
  
    IFTP - added FTPS (SSL FTP) support (see first section). 

    KEYSTACK - increased maximum string to 8192 characters. 

    LIST - has two new options "/Ln" to start at line "n", and "/Bn" to 
      start at byte offset "n". 
      
    LIST - added Unicode display toggle 'U' (.INI key directive ListUnicode) 
      or toolbar button in Take Command (Unicode versions only). 

    LIST (4NT) - added mousewheel support. 
     
    LIST (4NT) - if no filename is specified (and STDIN is not redirected), 
      LIST will now open the Windows "open file" dialog. 
       
    LIST (4NT) - the 'O' key (.INI key directive ListOpen) or the Ctrl-O key 
      will open the Windows "open file" dialog to select a new file to list. 

    LIST - added support for HTTP files. 

    LIST - added the Ctrl-L key (LIST selected file) to Take Command.  (It 
      was already in 4NT.)
  
    MKLNK - added support for creating soft links (directory junctions).  

    MOVE - (XP only) added /Y switch to force a copy of an encrypted file 
      even when the target will be decrypted. 

    MOVE - the /N switch now displays how many files would be moved. 
     
    MOVE - the /P(rompt) switch will no longer turn off the /Q(uiet) 
      switch.  (A /P and /Q will still prompt for the filenames, but 
      it will not display the totals.) 

    MOVE - added /U check for filesystems with different time 
      resolutions. 

    MOVE - the /V switch now does a true byte-by-byte comparison between 
      the source and the newly-created target file (when it is created 
      on a different volume). 

    OPTION - specifying an option name alone will display the value of 
      that option. 
         
    OPTION - added an "Apply" button. 

    REN - the /N switch now displays how many files would be renamed. 
     
    REN - the /P(rompt) switch will no longer turn off the /Q(uiet) 
      switch.  (A /P and /Q will still prompt for the filenames, but 
      it will not display the totals.) 
       
    SENDMAIL - added support for @con: in the message text (optionally 
      from a file) field.  (This also now allows piping message text into 
      SENDMAIL.) 
       
    SENDMAIL - added support for @clip: in the message text field. 
       
    SENDMAIL - has new options to request delivery notification, set the 
      importance, set the priority, and specify BCC addresses. 
    
    SET - if there is only a single argument and it contains wildcards 
      (* or ?), SET will display matching on existing variable names. 
       
    SETDOS - the /C, /E, and /P options will now accept decimal or hex  
      ASCII values; i.e. "setdos /c94". 
     
    SET - added the /E option to also set the local environment when setting
      registry variables.

    SETDOS - removed the useless /U option. 

    SHRALIAS - now shares the lists (alias, history, directory history,  
      and user functions) between 4NT and Take Command. 
       
    START - has a new option "/Affinity=n" to set the processor affinity  
      for this process. 

    TAIL - the /N switch has a new option "/N+x" to start at the x'th line  
      from the beginning of the file. 
      
    TAIL - added support for HTTP and HTTPS files  
     
    TREE - changed the display when using the /F switch to differentiate 
      between files and subdirectories. 

    TYPE - added support for HTTP and HTTPS files. 

    UNSET - added the /E option to also unset the local environment when
      unsetting registry variables.
