SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT AND LIMITED WARRANTY for Trial and Registered 
Copies

If you don't agree with the terms below, you should not use or evaluate
this Software.

In this agreement:

   "Software" means the JP Software product(s) you have obtained for 
   evaluation or purchased, including the software, documentation, and 
   other materials;

   "Trial Copy" means a copy of the Software for which you have not paid
   a fee to us or one of our authorized dealers (Trial Copies are typically 
   described as "trial" or "shareware" copies in the Software's sign-on 
   messages);

   "Registered Copy" means a copy of the Software for which you have paid 
   a fee to us or to one of our authorized dealers, and which is not 
   described as a trial or shareware copy in the Program's sign-on messages;

   "We" or "us" means JP Software Inc., a corporation based in Chestertown,
   Maryland, USA;

   "You" means the evaluator or end user of the Software;

(1) Legal Agreement.  This legal agreement allows you to use the Software 
under the terms and conditions below.

(2) Ownership.  We or our licensors own the Software under copyright, trade
secret and all other laws that may apply.  All JP Software product names, 
designs, and logos are trademarks of JP Software Inc.

(3) Evaluation Period.  You may use a Trial Copy of the Software for an 
evaluation period of up to 30 days, in order to determine whether the 
Software meets your needs before purchasing a license.  Your evaluation 
period begins when you first install the Software on one or more computers
for evaluation purposes.  Once the evaluation period ends, you agree to 
either purchase a license for the Software, or to stop using it.  If you 
have ordered a Purchased Copy of the Software from us or from one of our
authorized dealers you may continue to use your Trial Copy until your 
Purchased Copy arrives.

(4) Use of the Trial Software.  While you are evaluating the Software, 
you may use it on as many computers as are required to perform your 
evaluation.  However, once the evaluation period is over and you purchase 
a license for the Software, your use will be restricted to the number of 
computers for which you have purchased licenses, under the license 
agreement which applies to your Registered Copy.

(5) Making and Distributing Trial Copies of the Software.  You may make 
copies of your Trial Copy of the Software to give to others, as long as 
you include all of the files that you originally received with your Trial
Copy.  You agree not to sell Trial Copies of the Software or distribute 
them to others for any kind of compensation or fee.

(6) Use of Individual Copies.  If you purchased an individual copy of the
Software it may be installed for a single person's use on one or more 
Computers (such as a Computer at work, a Computer at home, and a portable 
Computer), as long as all Computers are primarily for that person's use at
all times, each computer is normally kept at a different location (address)
than the others, and they are never used simultaneously except during 
active transfer of files between them.  (If the Software copy was purchased
by your employer, you must obtain your employer's explicit permission 
before installing the Software on multiple Computers as described above.)

(7) Multi-System Licenses.  If you purchased a multi-system (rather than 
individual) license for the Software, you may install the Software on at 
most the number of Computers licensed, as shown on the program signon screen
or authorized in other electronic or printed documents received from us or 
our dealer.  Unlike individual copies, under a multi-system license each 
Computer (work, home, portable, etc.) is counted separately, even if the 
Computers are not in use simultaneously.

(8) Suites.  If you purchased two or more programs packaged together as a
unit by us (a "Suite"), all programs in the Suite are licensed together as
a single unit and must be used on the same Computer(s).  You may not split
the programs within a Suite between different Computers in any way which 
results in use of the Software or any part thereof on more Computers than
are otherwise authorized by this license.

(9) Copying and Distribution of Registered Copies.  You may copy the 
Software files as necessary for normal backup purposes.  In addition, you 
may give the trial version of the Software to individual friends and 
colleagues you know personally, without your serial number or registration 
keys.  You may not make, sell, or give to others, any other whole or 
partial copy of the Software, without our advance written permission.

(9) Registration Keys.  Any registration keys you receive in order to 
personalize, install, or register  the software are private and confidential 
information known only to you and to us, and may not be given to others 
under any circumstances.

(10) LIMITED WARRANTY for Physical Defects.  We pledge that any CDs 
physically delivered to you will arrive free of physical defects interfering 
with normal use.  If you report such a defect to us within 90 days after 
purchase, we will replace the defective unit(s) at no charge.  We don't 
promise that the Software will be free of software bugs or program errors.  
If  you report an error or bug to us, we will address it as part of our 
normal maintenance procedures.  If we issue a maintenance release for the 
Software containing a correction for an error you reported, we will make a 
copy of that release available to you for electronic download at no charge.  
We will only do this for maintenance releases, not for other new versions 
of the Software.

(11) Satisfaction Guarantee.  If you are dissatisfied with any JP Software 
product you buy from us under this Agreement for any reason, you may return 
it to us at any time up to 90 days after purchase and we will refund the 
amount you paid, less shipping and handling costs.  You must contact us 
before returning any product for a refund.  This satisfaction guarantee 
does not apply to multi-system licenses for more than 10 Computers, or to 
purchases of more than 10 individual copies.

(12) DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATIONS, and RESTRICTED RIGHTS.

  >> DISCLAIMER (Trial Copy):  YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR THE TRIAL USE LICENSE 
  FOR YOUR TRIAL COPY OF THE PROGRAM.  ACCORDINGLY THE TRIAL COPY IS PROVIDED
  "AS-IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED 
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  YOU 
  ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTION AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE TO 
  ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU USE THE SOFTWARE
  IMPROPERLY OR AGAINST OUR INSTRUCTIONS YOU CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR FILES,
  SOFTWARE AND DATA.

  >> DISCLAIMER (Registered Copy):  Except for the Limited Warranty stated 
  above, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING 
  ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
  PURPOSE.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAD FULL OPPORTUNITY TO USE
  AND TEST THE SOFTWARE BEFORE PURCHASE, SO THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF 
  THE ABOVE WARRANTIES IS FULFILLED EVEN WHERE A REFUND MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.
  YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTION AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE 
  TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU USE IT 
  IMPROPERLY OR AGAINST OUR INSTRUCTIONS YOU CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR FILES,
  SOFTWARE AND DATA.  The Limited Warranty above gives you specific legal 
  rights, but you may have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction to 
  jurisdiction.

  >> HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.  THE SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT 
  DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE AS ONLINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT 
  IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, such as in 
  the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication
  systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons 
  systems, or any other environment in which the failure of the Software 
  could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or 
  environmental damage ("High Risk Activities").  WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM
  ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES FOR
  THE SOFTWARE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF.

  >> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
  INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT 
  OF USE OF THE PROGRAM OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US.  Some jurisdictions
  do not allow exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or 
  consequential damages, therefore the above limitation may not apply to you.

  >> EXPORT.  You may use the Software in any country, except countries that
  are subject to U.S. export restrictions.  You are solely responsible for 
  determining whether any planned export relating to the Software is legal 
  under U.S. and other applicable laws.

  >> RESTRICTED RIGHTS LEGEND:  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. 
  Government subject to the restrictions set forth in DFARS 252.227-7013 
  (c)(1)(ii) and FAR 52.227-19.
