                     MSWINERR.TXT -- September 21, 2002

This list shows a typical set of error and system messages returned by
Microsoft Windows.  The numbers are what would be potentially returned in
internal variable _SYSERR by our command processors.

This particular list happens to be from a Windows 2000 configuration and your
own installation will probably provide different messages, but most DOS and
Windows versions use many of the same entries.

THIS IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE!!

8482 The schema update operation tried to add a backward link attribute
     that has no corresponding forward link.
8483 Source and destination of a cross-domain move do not agree on the
     object's epoch number. Either source or destination does not have
     the latest version of the object.
8484 Source and destination of a cross-domain move do not agree on the
     object's current name. Either source or destination does not have
     the latest version of the object.
8485 Source and destination for the cross-domain move operation are
     identical. Caller should use local move operation instead of
     cross-domain move operation.
8486 Source and destination for a cross-domain move are not in
     agreement on the naming contexts in the forest. Either source or
     destination does not have the latest version of the Partitions
     container.
8487 Destination of a cross-domain move is not authoritative for the
     destination naming context.
8488 Source and destination of a cross-domain move do not agree on the
     identity of the source object. Either source or destination does
     not have the latest version of the source object.

     by the destination server. The source server does not have the
     latest version of the source object.
8490 Another operation which requires exclusive access to the PDC FSMO
     is already in progress.
8491 A cross-domain move operation failed such that two versions of the
     moved object exist - one each in the source and destination
     domains. The destination object needs to be removed to restore the
     system to a consistent state.
8492 This object may not be moved across domain boundaries either
     because cross-domain moves for this class are disallowed, or the
     object has some special characteristics, eg: trust account or
     restricted RID, which prevent its move.
8493 Can't move objects with memberships across domain boundaries as
     once moved, this would violate the membership conditions of the
     account group. Remove the object from any account group
     memberships and retry.
8494 A naming context head must be the immediate child of another
     naming context head, not of an interior node.
8495 The directory cannot validate the proposed naming context name
     because it does not hold a replica of the naming context above the
     proposed naming context. Please ensure that the domain naming
     master role is held by a server that is configured as a global
8496 Destination domain must be in native mode.
8497 The operation can not be performed because the server does not
     have an infrastructure container in the domain of interest.
8498 Cross-domain move of account groups is not allowed.
8499 Cross-domain move of resource groups is not allowed.
8500 The search flags for the attribute are invalid. The ANR bit is
     valid only on attributes of Unicode or Teletex strings.
8501 Tree deletions starting at an object which has an NC head as a
     descendant are not allowed.
8502 The directory service failed to lock a tree in preparation for a
     tree deletion because the tree was in use.

8507 An attempt is made to modify the base schema.
8508 Adding a new mandatory attribute to an existing class, deleting a
     mandatory attribute from an existing class, or adding an optional
     attribute to the special class Top that is not a backlink
     attribute (directly or through inheritance, for example, by addin
8509 Schema update is not allowed on this DC. Either the registry key
     is not set or the DC is not the schema FSMO Role Owner.
8510 An object of this class cannot be created under the schema
     container. You can only create attribute-schema and class-schema
     objects under the schema container.
8511 The replica/child install failed to get the objectVersion
     attribute on the schema container on the source DC. Either the
     attribute is missing on the schema container or the credentials
     supplied do not have permission to read it.

     class-schema object.
8523 Only DSAs configured to be Global Catalog servers should be
     allowed to hold the Domain Naming Master FSMO role.
8524 The DSA operation is unable to proceed because of a DNS lookup
     failure.
8525 While processing a change to the DNS Host Name for an object, the
     Service Principal Name values could not be kept in sync.
8526 The Security Descriptor attribute could not be read.
8527 The object requested was not found, but an object with that key
     was found.
8528 The syntax of the linked attribute being added is incorrect.
     Forward links can only have syntax 2.5.5.1, 2.5.5.7, and 2.5.5.14,
     and backlinks can only have syntax 2.5.5.1

8538 The source object must be a group or user.
8539 The source object's SID already exists in destination forest.
8540 The source and destination object must be of the same type.
8542 Schema information could not be included in the replication
     request.
8543 The replication operation could not be completed due to a schema
     incompatibility.
8544 The replication operation could not be completed due to a previous
     schema incompatibility.
8545 The replication update could not be applied because either the
     source or the destination has not yet received information
     regarding a recent cross-domain move operation.
8546 The requested domain could not be deleted because there exist
     domain controllers that still host this domain.
8547 The requested operation can be performed only on a global catalog
     server.
8548 A local group can only be a member of other local groups in the
     same domain.
8549 Foreign security principals cannot be members of universal groups.
8550 The attribute is not allowed to be replicated to the GC because of
     security reasons.
8551 The checkpoint with the PDC could not be taken because there too
     many modifications being processed currently.
8552 The operation requires that source domain auditing be enabled.
8553 Security principal objects can only be created inside domain
     naming contexts.
8554 A Service Principal Name (SPN) could not be constructed because
     the provided hostname is not in the necessary format.
8555 A Filter was passed that uses constructed attributes.
8556 The unicodePwd attribute value must be enclosed in double quotes.
8557 Your computer could not be joined to the domain. You have exceeded
     the maximum number of computer accounts you are allowed to create
     in this domain. Contact your system administrator to have this
     limit reset or increased.
8558 For security reasons, the operation must be run on the destination
     DC.
8559 For security reasons, the source DC must be Service Pack 4 or
     greater.
8560 Critical Directory Service System objects cannot be deleted during
     tree delete operations. The tree delete may have been partially
