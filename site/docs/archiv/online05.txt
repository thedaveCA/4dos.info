   **>> Latest Versions of 4DOS, 4NT, and Take Command/32 <<**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

>> What?  You Missed the Upgrade??
   Newest Releases Offer FTP Support - and Over 200 Other Enhancements

If you're still on 4DOS 6.02 (or below), 4NT 3.02, or Take Command/32
2.02 -- or any earlier versions -- then perhaps you missed last year's
major upgrades.  Well, they're still available -- and at the same low
price.  Here are some highlights ...

    FTP Support:

        The single biggest enhancement in these versions is FTP
        support (in 4NT and Take Command).  This support extends
        across many commands and functions (e.g. you can use most file
        oriented commands -- COPY, DEL, MOVE, REN, TYPE, etc.  -- on
        FTP servers).  It enables file management on FTP servers from
        the command line, and brings all of the capabilities of 4NT
        and Take Command/32's enhanced batch scripting language to
        automation of FTP transfers.  It's an important tool for web
        developers, and anyone maintaining a web or FTP server and
        needing to manage it using familiar commands, and/or automate
        their work.  See the first "Tech Tip" below for details on how
        to use these features.

    @file Lists:

        Another significant addition, "@file" lists, adds even more
        flexibility to file processing, allowing you to take a list of
        files generated by another command, or another application,
        and use it as input to any file processing command.  Use @file
        lists to find text in files and then process only those files
        containing the matching text, to change the order in which
        files are copied or moved, or use the same file lists for
        internal commands and external applications with similar
        features (e.g.  .ZIP file tools).  See the second "Tech Tip"
        below for more information.

    Usability Improvements:

        We've also added plenty of little things that help with
        usability - like server and sharename completion on the
        command line, variable name completion, a more robust way to
        handle standard text-mode applications in Take Command/32, and
        dozens more.  And there are over 100 enhancements to existing
        commands, giving you more command line power and flexibility
        than ever.

    Batch File Enhancements:

        For batch programmers, this release offers a wide range of
        additional enhancements, including over 40 new variables and
        functions that offer capabilities like manipulation of the
        Windows registry, access to Windows system data, new
        arithmetic calculations, additional date handling, and access
        to new Windows 2000 file attributes.

In addition all products are fully compatible with the latest
operating systems including Windows NT / 2000 / XP and Windows 95 /98
/ ME.

The price for all this?  Just $34.95 for the first product, $19.95 for
each additional product, or $54.95 for the JP CD Suite.  Plus if you
currently have one or more individual products you can convert to the
CD Suite with all products for just $69.95!

For additional details see the "What's New" section of the online help
for each product.  A file with essentially the entire list of changes
is also available -- check the ASCII files area of our web site at
http://jpsoft.com/ for WHATSNEW.TXT.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

>> Latest Maintenance Releases

The latest releases of our most popular command line tools are 4DOS
7.01, 4NT 4.01, and Take Command/32 3.01.  Earlier this year we also
released a maintenance upgrade to 4OS2, version 3.03.

To download these latest releases, visit:

    * Our web site at http://jpsoft.com/

    * Our FTP site at ftp.jpsoft.com.  See the product subdirectories
      for the file for each product (these are the same files
      available from our web page).

This maintenance release includes bug fixes and compatibility
enhancements developed since our last release.  It does not include
any major new features or functions.  For complete details on all
changes see the "What's New" topic in the online help, or the
same information available from the Technical Support area of our web
page.

If you are currently running 4DOS 7.00, 4NT 4.00, or Take Command/32
3.00, this is a minor upgrade.  To update your current copy, simply
download the new version and install in a new directory (or over the
old one if you wish).  For manual installation, see the brief
instructions in README.TXT and/or the more detailed instructions in
the ASCII Introduction and Installation Guide (included with the
downloaded files).

If this is a major upgrade for you (e.g. if you are running 4DOS 6.02,
4NT 3.02, or Take Command/32 2.02, and have not yet upgraded) please
see the previous article.

>> Understanding File Systems:  Something Old, Something New

Remember the good -- or, depending on your view, bad -- old days?  A 20
MB hard disk was large, and file names were 8 letters or numbers
followed by an extension of three more.  File systems were barely
mentioned because there was only one, and of course pretty much all work
on PCs was done in DOS and from the command line!

Things are a little different now.  Some people don't even know what
the command line is.  20 MB is more like a file size than a disk
size.  And you have to make sense of a plethora of file systems --
FAT, VFAT, CDFS, NTFS, NFS, and more.  What's more, each has its own
unique characteristics and many are not compatible with each other.

4DOS, 4NT, and Take Command can work with pretty much any file system
that's provided on the platforms they run on.  However there are real
differences in behavior that depend on both the operating system and
the file system.  Understanding these differences is important if you
work on multiple platforms, or with multiple file systems, as many
people do.

The operating systems under which our products run support four
standard file systems:  FAT, VFAT, FAT32, and NTFS.

   * The FAT File System is the traditional file system used by all
     versions of DOS.  Its name comes from the File Allocation Table
     DOS uses to keep track of the space allocated to each file.
     Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, and XP also support the FAT file
     system.

   * The VFAT File System is an extension of the FAT file system
     available in Windows 95 and above.  This system maintains
     additional information about files on FAT drives, including long
     filenames (LFNs).

   * The FAT32 File System is an additional extension to the VFAT file
     system.  It is available in Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2
     ("OEMSR2"), and in Windows 98, ME, 2000, and XP.  It is similar
     to VFAT, but supports larger disk drives.  It is not supported
     under Windows NT 4.0 or earlier, or under DOS.

   * The Windows NT File System or NTFS is a file system provided with
     all versions of Windows NT / 2000 / XP.  It is not an extension
     of any of the FAT-based systems, and instead uses a new design to
     support long file names and to offer improved performance and
     support for large drives.

In addition, you probably have access to one or more file systems
which are on other computers accessed across a network.  Those file
systems may be any of the ones listed above -- or may be completely
different systems such as Unix, VMS, or Netware file systems, whose
rules and functions are quite different from the systems you are used
to under DOS and Windows.

The remainder of this article discusses some of the issues you can
run into when working with a range of file systems, and how features
of 4DOS, 4NT, and Take Command can help.


File Names

Often the most obvious difference between file systems is in the names
allowed.  FAT systems support only traditional "8.3" names -- those
with an 8-character name and a 3-character extension, all in upper
case.  All of the other common systems allow longer file names,
usually up to about 255 characters.

If you are using a system which supports long filenames you can
convert between the long and short names while typing at the command
line, or programmatically in a command or batch file.  To convert
while typing, type part of the name you want, then press Tab until the
file name has been filled in.  Normally this will display the long
filename; to see the short name instead, press Ctrl-A. Press Ctrl-A
again to toggle back to the long name.  This feature allows you to,
for example, display the long name of a file and then switch to the
short name in order to pass it to an older program which does not
handle long filenames.

In any command or batch file you can also use the @SFN and @LFN
functions to perform these conversions, for example:

     c:\>echo %@sfn["My Documents"]
     C:\MYDOCU~1

     c:\>echo %@lfn[MYDOCU~1]
     C:\My Documents

In addition the characters allowed in file names vary from system to
system.  A complete discussion of the characters allowed is beyond our
scope here, but on FAT systems you can use alphabetic and numeric
characters plus the punctuation marks ! # $ % & ' ( ) - @ ^ _ ` { }
and ~ in both the name and the extension of a file.  Other
Windows-based file systems may allow additional characters, though
non-Windows systems tend to be more restrictive.

Because the exclamation point [!], percent sign [%], caret [^], at
sign [@], parentheses [()], and back-quote [`] also have other
meanings to 4DOS, 4NT, and Take Command, it is best to avoid using
them in filenames.  If you do find filenames with these characters in
them there are several ways to handle them.  Here are some examples:

   * For the % sign, use two -- to delete the file named my%file:

          del my%%file

   * Use the escape character ("%=") to remove the usual special
     meaning of the next character:

          del my%=%file

   * Place backquotes around the filename to prevent special
     characters from being processed when the command is first
     examined:

         del `my%file`

   * Use SETDOS /X to disable the special meaning of certain
     characters (e.g. the backquote, or the command separator
     character).  See SETDOS /X for additional details.

   * Use a wildcard character in brackets if there is no other file
     name it will match; this command will delete all files whose
     name is "my", then any single character, then "file":

          del my[?]file

The last two methods will only work for internal commands.  The others
will generally work for external commands as well.  The last method --
using [?] -- is the most robust and easiest, but can be dangerous if
you have other similarly named files as it can match more than one
filename.


Upper and Lower Case

All of the DOS and Windows file systems described above (except the
original FAT system) are "case-retentive", meaning they remember
filenames as they were created with both upper and lower case letters.
However they are also "case-insensitive", meaning that you can refer
to the file MyFile as MYFILE or myfile or MyFile, all are equivalent.
For this reason you will not usually have to modify or deal with the
case of filenames under these systems.

Network file systems, on the other hand, particularly those running
under Unix, are often case-sensitive -- that is, MyFile, MYFILE, and
myfile all refer to different files.  When accessing these systems you
may want to take some steps to make sure you are using the correct
file names.  Here are some areas where this can affect you:

     DIR:  Don't use the /E or /L switches when displaying directories
     for case-sensitive file systems.  These switches force the DIR
     output to upper or lower case, which will prevent DIR from
     displaying the true names of the files.

     COPY, MD, MOVE, RD, REN, etc.:  Commands which handle files or
     directories must be given the correct name, including upper and
     lower case characters, or they will not be able to find the file.
     The same applies to variable functions.

     When copying or moving files to case-sensitive file systems you
     may need to force the case to be what you want.  For example,
     this command will copy the file JANDATA.ZIP to an FTP site using
     4NT or Take Command/32's FTP features, and store it with an upper
     case name on the target file system:

          copy JANDATA.ZIP "ftp://ftp.somesite.com/"

     In most cases you will want such an operation to convert the
     filename to lower case, rather than making assumptions about how
     it will be transferred.  You can do this explicitly:

          copy JANDATA.ZIP "ftp://ftp.somesite.com/jandata.zip"

     Or if you do it frequently, you can set up an alias.  This
     example copies the file to a named FTP site, and forces the name
     to lower case (the FOR command is used to allow wildcard file
     names).  Be sure to enter the alias on one line:

          alias lcopy `for %file in (%1) copy %file
               "ftp://%2/%@lower[%file]"`

     To use this alias:

          lcopy JANDATA.ZIP ftp.somesite.com


International Issues

One area that causes a lot of confusion is the use of "international"
(non-English) characters in filenames.

Under the FAT-based file systems you will generally find that any
legal character from the 255-character extended ASCII set that you can
enter on your keyboard can be used in a filename and will be stored
and retrieved properly.  Your online help lists these characters under
"Reference Information" in the "ASCII and Key Codes" topics.

However, when using Windows NT's NTFS file system, which supports the
use of "Unicode" in filenames to handle a wider range of characters,
the issue is far more complex.  Windows will convert any characters
you enter to Unicode prior to storing them as part of the filename,
and will convert them back to ASCII when retrieving them for
non-Unicode programs like 4NT and Take Command.

This conversion is "symmetric" for standard English-language
characters, so the character you type for the filename is the one you
will see in directories and can use in file processing commands and
functions.  However for non-English characters the conversion
performed by Windows unfortunately is not symmetric, so that if you
(for example) enter an "o" with a German "umlaut" over it in a
filename, the character may appear completely different when displayed
in a DIR, and may not match properly when used to manipulate the file.
This problem does not affect all non-English characters, only some of
them; occurs only on NTFS drives; and is less likely to cause trouble
in Take Command than in 4NT; nevertheless, it can be quite confusing
when it does happen.

At this time the only easy solution to this problem is to use
the [?] wildcard for the character in question, for example:

     ren dankesch[?]n dankeschon

Note that this will also attempt to rename other matching files with
similar names, and any character in the next to last position.  (A
future version of 4NT and Take Command may provide Unicode support to
address this issue, but development plans for such a version are still
under discussion and are not final at this time.)


Other Issues

There are a number of other issues where file systems differ which we
don't have room to go into in detail here, but we can give you a brief
"heads-up" on some areas you should be aware of:

   - Under Windows 2000 and XP, NTFS drives can store a range of extra
     file "attributes" such as "temporary" or "offline".  These are
     not available in FAT-based systems, nor on NTFS pre-Windows 2000.
     See the online help for details.

   - Translations between file attributes on different operating
     systems are not usually reliable.  In particular, there is no
     clear way to map Unix file permissions to DOS and Windows file
     attributes, and attempts to manipulate permissions on Unix
     systems through a network using 4DOS, 4NT, or Take Command are
     likely to fail completely, or yield incorrect results.  To
     address this use a Unix-based tool or stand-alone FTP software to
     change the Unix permissions.

   - Not all file systems correctly identify themselves or their
     characteristics when working in a network environment.  In
     particular, the file system on another machine may appear to
     support long filenames when it does not.  Similarly, a directory
     may appear to 4DOS, 4NT, or Take Command to be a file, or vice
     versa.  If you see odd results from DIR (e.g. empty directories
     that you know have files, or mangled filenames) you should
     suspect that the file system on the other machine is not
     identifying itself and its characteristics correctly to 4DOS,
     4NT, or Take Command.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

>> Command Line Features You Forgot

All too often, we get "suggestions" to add a feature to 4DOS, 4NT, or
Take Command when the requested feature is already present.  Usually,
it's been there for years!  This is no surprise -- with such a large
feature set it's easy to find benefits in only a small subset of
what's offered, and at times forget what else might be there.

For this article we looked back through the list of command line
features, and thought we'd remind you of a few you may have forgotten.
(These descriptions use typical 4DOS and 4NT keystrokes; a few may be
different in Take Command):

   * Command Completion:  This is basic but we've seen many
     experienced users ignore it.  Need to recall a previous command?
     Type the first part of it and press up-arrow, and you'll see only
     the matching commands.  This way there's almost never any need to
     press up-arrow repeatedly to search for a command -- even if all
     you remember is the first letter, you can speed up your search
     considerably.

     If you use command completion and see some useless commands in
     the history that are messing up your scan for the one you want,
     press Ctrl-D instead of the up-arrow.  That will delete the
     useless command and proceed to the next one, and next time it
     won't be there.

   * History Options:  Do you wish the command you just recalled would
     stay at the end of the history where you could find it again
     quickly, and in sequence?  Tired of going around in circles in
     the history list?  There are a whole range of configuration
     options that let you control how the command history works.  We
     don't have room to cover all of them in detail here, but you can
     read about them in the Configuration section of the online help.
     See History and LocalHistory under Initialization Directives, or
     on the Startup page of the configuration dialogs.  Also see
     HistCopy, HistMin, HistMove, and HistWrap under Configuration
     Directives, or on the History page of the configuration dialogs.

   * Automatic Directory Changes:  Are you still using CD (or CDD) to
     change directories?  That's the old way -- in most cases it's
     quicker to just type the directory name, followed by a backslash,
     and let the command processor find the directory for you.  For
     even more flexibility, enable extended directory searches and you
     can type just part of the name; see Directory Navigation in the
     online help for details.

   * Variable Name Completion:  This works like filename completion.
     If the argument begins with a %, the completion routines will
     scan the environment for matching variable names.  For example,
     if the PROMPT and PATH variables are in the environment, in that
     order, this sequence might be used to display the PATH:

          [c:\] echo %p<Tab>
          [c:\] echo %PROMPT<Tab>
          [c:\] echo %PATH<Enter>

   * Customized Filename Completion:  Don't see the file names you
     want when you press Tab or the other filename completion keys?
     Check out the AppendToDir, CompleteHidden, and FileCompletion
     directives that you can add to your .INI file for a range of
     customization options (e.g. to add backslashes automatically to
     directory names, to only complete .TXT files when you are
     entering a NOTEPAD command, or to see only directories when
     typing an RD command).  The same options are on the Editing tab
     of the configuration dialogs.

   * F3:  That's right, the ancient F3 command that used to be one of
     the only ways to edit the command line.  What does it do?  It
     adds the rest of the previous command line on to the current one,
     starting after the characters you've typed.  Here's one simple
     use, to create a directory and change to it:

          [c:\] md newdir
          [c:\] c<F3>

     When you press F3 the command processor substitutes the rest of
     the previous line -- in this case, "d newdir", and fills in the
     command:

          cd newdir

     Then just press Enter to execute it.

   * Keystroke Aliases:  These assign a command to a single keystroke.
     They're often used with function keys, for example to use Alt-F4
     to enter and execute an "exit" command in 4DOS:

          alias @@Alt-F4 exit

     For complete details see the ALIAS command in the online help.

This of course is only a sample -- if you'd like to review more,
browse through the online help, reviewing the sections titled "The
Command Line", "File Selection", and "Directory Navigation".
