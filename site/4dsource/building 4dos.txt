1. Building 4DOS.COM
You need patch(1), MASM 6.11d or 6.15 and VC 1.5x with library sources (for msdos.h).

       1. Apply CODE.DIF against the original source code release by Rex Conn.
       2. Create a DOS sub-directory. 4DOS.COM will be there if built successfully.
       3. Modify MSC7.BTM to set your environment variables PATH, INCLUDE, LIB.
       4. Run MKDOS.BTM. You should see one inevitable A4013 warning. Ignore it.

Before modifying the code, increment both VER_BUILD and INTVER so that the
new shell does not inherit the old one, or it will crash soon or later. OPTION
must be rebuilt to work with each build.

2. Building OPTION.EXE
You need Watcom C, MASM 5.10 and Mix C/WinDOS Toolchest with source code.

       1. Install the binary and source versions of the Mix C/WinDOS Toochest.
       2. Apply CWIND.DIF against the source code of the library and build it.
       3. Unzip the OPTION sources into a subdirectory of the 4DOS sources.
       4. Edit MAKESET.BTM to set your environment variables WATCOM, TUI.
       5. Type "MAKE OPTION R".



3. Building 4HELP/4MAKE/HELPCFG
You need BP7 (TP7), TPRO5, BP7PATCH, Turbofix, EDITOOLS4.

       1. Install BP7, EDITOOLS4 and TPRO5 and build the latter's units.
       2. Apply the BP7 patch and Turbofix.
       3. Update
          tpcmd.pas,tpdos.pas,tpedit.pas,tpinline.pas,tpmemchk.pas,tpstring.pas
          and tpcrt.pas and copy tpdefine.inc,tppick.in1 and tpmouse.asm from TPRO5.
       4. Apply 4HELP.DIF and adjust TPC.CFG and BUILD.BTM for your environment.
       5. Run BUILD.BTM.
