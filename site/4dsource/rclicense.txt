The Libre Commons Res Communes

Licence text:

The Res Communes licence is designed to reject a state-centred legal
construct of a commons (or commons without communality) in order to concentrate
on creating a common which is shared between us in collective practices (a
commons with commonality). The 'Commune' or the 'Commonality' originally meant
'the people of the whole realm' or 'all the King's subjects' as opposed to the
King, the Nobles or the 'Commons' in Parliament. We here refer to the
commonality to refer to the global multitude, the people of the whole world.

1. This work is outside of all legal jurisdictions and takes its force and
action from the constituent radical democratic practices of the global
multitude against the logic of the capital.

2. All work that is so inscribed should bear the text 
'L <year> Libre Commons Res Communes Licence.'

3. As a user of this licence the work is available to be shared and used as
a part of a common creative substrate that is shared between us.
